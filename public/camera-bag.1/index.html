<p><em>Summary: Details with pictures the contents of QT Luong&rsquo;s 5x7/35mm
general-purpose camera bag, and explains some of the reasons behind
equipment choices.</em></p>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/">Q.-Tuan Luong</a> for
<a href="/">largeformatphotography.info</a></strong></p>

<p>This article describes the gear I carry in my general-purpose
large-format bag, the reasons why I chose that gear, and how it is
organized inside the bag. All the items described, with the exception of
35mm equipment that is sometimes taken out separately, are left
permanently in the bag. This makes it possible for me to always know
where eachitem is. It also prevents me from forgetting to pack
something.</p>

<p>While inadequate for backpacking or even some long hikes (another
article will detail my camera bags for those situations), for working
near the car and moderate hikes (as long as the Subway in Zion), the
Lowepro Super-trekker is my choice because it provides quick access,
good organization, and reasonable carrying ability. In addition, it
offers sufficient protection for shipping by air, and a rain cover that
makes it possible to leave it or cache it outside even in rainy weather.
I have checked in the bag numerous times with minimal damage to the gear
(limited to the cable releases). I have also left it several times out
in the elements, for example when working in Denali together with a
camping backpack (I want to reassure you that I wasn&rsquo;t carrying both
simultaneously, but a discussion of Denali logistics would be alone
worth another article).</p>

<strong>The exterior of my Super-trekker.</strong></p>

<p>When I don&rsquo;t carry the tripod by hand, it is secured to the bag in
central position by the bungee cord with blue hooks. The default bungee
cords, which are not as strong, are used to carry additional clothing
when needed. With my cheap bungee cord positioned that way, a Gitzo 1325
can easily be carried on the bag. Carrying such a large tripod on the
side would make the bag too unbalanced. The two external pockets are
used to carry non-photographic items including food, water, and
accessories such as umbrella, hat, gloves, knife, headlamp, map, and GPS
unit.</p>

<h3 id="the-intermediate-level">The intermediate level</h3>

<p><img src="super-trekker2.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;467&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>The intermediate level of my Super-trekker.</strong></p>

<p>On the inside of the cover flap, there is a mesh pocket which normally
contains just the focussing cloth. I use the Darkroom Innovations
excellent cloth (compact, light, wind-proof, water-resistant, and above
all, ensures good darkness, thanks to its tube design and elasticised
opening). Occasionally, the same mesh pocket would be used to carry
additional film in a boxes and a small changing bag, or a few more 5x7
holders.</p>

<p>On top of the bag&rsquo;s main compartment, there is a removable foam panel
with four clear zippered pockets that contains any accessories. For
shipping, I simply reverse this panel to protect the contents inside the
pockets, which would then be facing inside. One of the small pockets is
dedicated to 35mm accessories (film, spare battery, double spirit
level). The three other zippered pockets are detailed below.</p>

<p><img src="accessories1.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;515&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>The small zippered pocket.</strong></p>

<p>This pocket contains the two most indispensable accessories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Silvestri tilting focussing lupe (compact, tilt useful for
combatting the light-falloff in the corners, 6x magnification useful
with fine-grained focussing screens such as the Boss).</li>
<li>Bracket to attach the Canham compendium shade to the front standard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other less used accessories include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microfiber lens cleaning cloth.</li>
<li>Small metric tape for calculating belows factor.</li>
<li>Autoknips II gadget for self-timer and repeatable timing of
exposures in the 2-4 sec. range.</li>
<li>Micron flashlight (LED, long lasting, diffuse light) and Maglite
solitaire (Tungsten bulb, brigher at a distance) to be used as
focussing aids in dim light, as well as for emergencies.</li>
<li>Spirit level (mostly for making sure standards are aligned with
extreme rises).</li>
<li>Hex key (for fixing problems with the QR plates).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="filters1.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;398&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>The middle zippered pocket.</strong></p>

<p>This pocket contains round filters for dual use 35mm/LF: they consist of
Heliopan warm-tone Kaeseman Circular polarizers in 72mm and 77mm, Nikon
81B warming filters in 72mm and 77mm. There is also a Heliopan
wide-angle linear polarizer (front element is larger than than filter
thread to preven vignetting) in 67mm, as well as Nikon a 52mm polarizer
which are both used only for LF. All round filters are in B&amp;W soft
plastic boxes. The Canon remote controler is used not only with the 35mm
camera (cable release, extended self-timer, long exposures), but also
its timing function is used for long LF exposures.</p>

<p><img src="filters2.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;472&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>The bottom zippered pocket</strong></p>

<p>This pocket contains a small Outdoor Research mesh bag which holds the
rectangular filter system, a Heliopan 0.45 center filter in 67mm to
compensate for light fall-off in some shots with the Schneider 110 XL
and the Nikkor <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> (this is carried in a push-on lens cap inside a soft
pouch), and a Lunar-Star F2 incident/flash meter (rarely used, as for
most landscape situations I prefer to meter with the 35mm camera).</p>

<p><img src="filters3.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;467&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>The filter bag</strong></p>

<p>The filter bag contains a Lee holder, wide-angle rings in 67mm and 77mm,
a regular ring in 52mm, three step-up rings to use the Lee holders on
other filter diameters, and a pouch containing resin Hitech filters.
Those include graduated neutral density 4x5 (GND), with both soft and
hard transistions in 2 f-stops and 3 f-stops, combination GND and
warming filter, and two 4x4 filters: warming filter (81B), and neutral
density filter (used to obtain longer exposures time to smooth moving
water). The Lee system, with its wide-angle rings, works without
vignetting even for wide-angle lenses. The Hitech filters are considered
as good as the Lee filters (some think they are produced by the same
factory), but their cost is lower.</p>

<h3 id="the-inside">The inside</h3>

<p><img src="super-trekker1.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;467&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>The inside of my Super-trekker.</strong></p>

<p>The inside of the bag contains the cameras, lenses, film holders. I
normally carry five or six 5x7 holders at a time. Note that I have added
two large Velcro pieces to hold more firmly the removable panel, since
the stock Velcro attachements are too small and would often let the
removable panel come loose. In 35mm, in general I carry one Canon EOS
body with a mid-range zoom, one telephoto zoom lens, and one wide-angle
zoom lens. The 35mm body is used not only independently, but also as a
viewfinder and a meter for the LF camera. The 35mmm equipment is placed
at the top of the bag, so I can access it without need to opening
entirely the bag or lay it flat. There is some space between the
external dividers and the exterior shell of the bag. This space is used
to carry the accessories listed in the next image.</p>

<p><img src="accessories3.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;590&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>Accessories carried on the periphery of the Super-trekker.</strong></p>

<p>Those accessories include the Canham compendium shade (always useful to
improve image contrast by reducing flare and cuting down the image
circle, also protects the lens while working in the rain), a small grey
card, four step-up rings that provide additional redundancy, should a
filter be misplaced or damaged, and a folded piece of foil that can be
attached to the removable panel of the Super-trekker to transform it
into a reflector. This can be useful for adding a bit of fill light for
macros shots or a close foreground.</p>

<p><img src="lenses.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;356&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>Large format lenses.</strong></p>

<p>I own 7 large format lenses, which cover focals from 90mm (equivalent of
a 18in 35mm) to 720 (equivalent of a 135 in 35mm). All of them are good
performers, relatively recent and multicoated, which is useful since my
work is color. You will remark that I have a mix of each of the four
major brands. Since I do not do work that require critical color
matching (such as product illustration), this has not posed me any
problem. All of my lenses are mounted on Technika lens boards, which is
the de-facto standard for field cameras, smaller than the Toyo boards (I
also own a Tech IV that I almost never use these days). I prefer the
original Technika boards. Despite lensboards being very simple objects,
there is actually a difference in quality. The four most frequently used
lenses have a cable release permanently attached to them to speed-up
set-up. It is necessary to remove the cable release before shipping,
since in my experience, the cable releases are the only piece of
equipment to have been damaged in transit (they break near the socket).
The front element is protected by a UV filter that I remove if the
weather conditions are fine. Those lenses, pictured on the first row (in
the four compartments above the camera) are, left to right:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuji C <sup>450</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>.5 (The long lens to have if you have enough bellows:
longest non-telephoto lens in a #1, amazingly compact and light for
the focal, huge image circle that will cover even 7x17)</li>
<li>Nikkor M <sup>300</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> (Compact and light Tessar-type lens of excellent
quality)</li>
<li>Schneider Apo-Symmar <sup>210</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.6 (Classic Plasmat lens, considered to be
one of the best. Slightly wider than a normal lens, it is the
easiest to focus among the lenses I own, thanks to the
aperture/focal length combination. My second most used lens)</li>
<li>Schneider Super-Symmar <sup>110</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.6 XL (Cutting-edge design for
remarkable compacity, weight, and brightness compared to the classic
Biogon-type wide-angle lenses, also more sharp corner to corner. I
use it for more than 50% of the images, equivalent to a 24 in 35mm)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are the following less used lenses, pictured on the
second row (left to right):</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikkor T <sup>720</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> (Telephoto design, usable with less than 600m of
bellows. I often leave this one behind, esp. on hikes. It&rsquo;s shallow
DOF, small image circle for 5x7, and above all sensitivity to
vibrations make it somehow difficult to use)</li>
<li>Rodenstock Apo-Sironar-S <sup>150</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.6 (Compact and light, but image
circle a bit tight for 5x7)</li>
<li>Nikkor SW <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> (The lightest of all modern 90mm lenses, it has also
more coverage than other <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> lenses, making it appropriate for 5x7)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 90 and 150 are carried in the same compartment, with the 90 secured
in a Domke wrapper.</p>

<p><img src="camera.jpg" alt="" />{width=&ldquo;700&rdquo; height=&ldquo;388&rdquo;}<br />
<strong>Large format camera and bag bellows.</strong></p>

<p>My camera of choice is the Canham wood field in the 5x7 format, with a
couple of modifications. I replaced the standard bellows with the more
flexible MQC bellows, as well as the rather coarse and dim focussing
screen with a Boss screen. I installed a metric scale on a focussing
rail, and two additional spirit levels, one on the back, and another one
on the bed. For more details, see my <a href="/canham/canham.html">review of the 5x7
KBC</a>. A Really Right Stuff plate is permanently
attached under the bed of the camera for tripod mounting. I carry the
wide-angle bellows underneath the camera (under a large grey card that
serves as divider), but since installing the MQC bellows, I have had
rarely the need for it.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This bag contains practically everything I need for photographing in
35mm and LF, and I can operate fast out of it. It might look big, but
there isn&rsquo;t much more room left for non-photographic items, or
photographic items such as additional 35mm lenses or additional LF backs
and holders. However, since it weights already more than 50lbs, I am not
sure I would want to carry more&hellip;</p>
