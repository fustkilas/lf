are able to travel at light speed, the passage of time is a constant.
Yet, the way we perceive twenty minutes in the dentist&rsquo;s chair, and
twenty minutes on the ski slopes could not be more different. Through my
work, I am investigating the nature of human perception of the passage
of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.millervisuals.com"><strong>Fine-Art Prints: Illustrations And Drawings Of Robert And Photographs
Of Martin Miller</strong></a> - For most of the last
32 years, I have been using photography as a creative means to explore
the metaphysical or spiritual dimension of life as distinct from its all
too pervasive material dimension. The natural world has been the subject
of my camera’s eye, but the mystery of the human psyche has been the
subject of my inner eye. The organizing principle of my work is no less
a challenge than the apprehension and expression through visual metaphor
of the hidden realms of the mind, the source of both our fears and our
miraculous creative capacities. My explorations have gravitated to three
sources of inspiration and insight into The Great Mystery: the
collective unconscious, mysticism, and the order/chaos synergy. The
literal subjects of my photographs may be wood, water, and rock, but, at
their best, they evoke the essential mystery of life and the possibility
of man&rsquo;s spirit transcending his material existence.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zonesystem.de"><strong>Fine Print Photography</strong></a> - The intense
occupation with black-and-white photography revealed me a great amount
of possibilities on picture compositions, ways of expression, showed me
the possible combinations of forms and tone scales. The higher time
expenditure and expense of the Large format equipment and of the own
laboratory require a more concentrated method of working. For a long
term though it pays itself off through more convincing pictures. The
intense occupation with black-and-white photography trained my eye for
graphic forms and special tone scale conditions. After a phase of &ldquo;color
abstinence&rdquo; I recognized the possibilities of extending these forms and
tone scale conditions also into the color photography, because I am
convinced that their conscious use can also be used there. I got clear
to me that neither an exclusive black-and-white nor exclusive color
photography is better but that every subject requires its own individual
conversion by the photographer instead. There seldom are subjects which
are really convincing at these two different worlds. I generally prefer
the black-and-white photography, but I would also further like to
sensitize conscious using of color as another element for the picture
composition. In first place, forms, the tone scale as well as their
relations to each other fascinate me. Their representation in gray or
color depends both on the subject and on my inner ideas. I am neither
pupil of Ansel Adams nor of Joseph Beuys. (Please check out my other
