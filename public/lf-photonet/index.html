<p>A personal perspective on the move of the LF Forum to photo.net</p>

<h2 id="a-personal-perspective-on-the-move-of-the-lf-forum-to-photo-net">A personal perspective on the move of the LF Forum to photo.net</h2>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/">Q.-Tuan Luong</a> for the <a href=".">Large
Format Page</a>, June 2002. Rev Sept 2003.</strong></p>

<p>I created the LF Forum in 1997, using the &ldquo;Lusenet&rdquo; software and hosting
provided by Philip Greenspun at greenspun.com. My understanding is that
at that time the main benefit for him in providing those services for
free was to showcase his expertise in DB-backed web sites. It turns out
the interface was designed with excellent taste, and was effective and
simple. It was probably no little factor in helping the forum grow. The
forum would not have existed without Philip Greenspun, not only for the
services, but also the inspiration. It was very close in spirit to the
original photo.net, although it could be argued that the original
photo.net was instrumental in helping Philip&rsquo;s tremendous web services
career, while I didn&rsquo;t expect much in return.</p>

<p>My vision was to provide a place where large format enthusiasts could
come and exchange freely ideas and help. No commercial activity would
ever take place there. No financial contribution would be required,
because I considered that the most valuable contribution would be the
time spent by members to contribute contents. No copyrights claims to
contents would be made, and the legalities were just to be similar to
those on Usenet, after which Lusenet was aptly named, based on good
common sense and courtesy.</p>

<h3 id="the-lf-community-and-photo-net">The LF community and photo.net</h3>

<p>This worked quite well, so well that in July 2000, I was approached by
photo.net staffers who expressed interest in integrating the LF contents
(page and forum) with photo.net. When they asked me what I would want
for working for them, I emailed back my requirements for being a
part-time employee. Remember that this was in the waning days of the
dot-com boom when it could be assumed they were a well-funded dotcom
startup. Subsequently, we had a conference call in which I learned there
was no compensation available. Various ways to &ldquo;monetize&rdquo; the community
were discussed, which didn&rsquo;t hold appeal to me. I thought that giving
the value of the contributions which had been made to the not-for-profit
site, including the amount of work I had put in it myself, transferring
it to a commercial venture (which photo.net had become at that time,
having been incorporated) for nothing material deserved some reflexion.
I initiated a poll on this page, archived in the links &ldquo;old polls&rdquo;. The
question was simply: &ldquo;Should the LF Forum move to photo.net ?&rdquo; The
results were clear, even more than the final results indicated, if you
had followed the vote. In the first week of voting, the ratio of &ldquo;No&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was around 4 to 1. It is reasonable to believe that those who
voted first were the more regular contributors. In addition, in only one
of the personal contacts (Ellis) that I had with other members, in
person, by phone, or by email, the move was recommended, whereas many
spoke strongly against it. This confirmed to me that while the silent
majority maybe didn&rsquo;t really care where the LF Forum be hosted as long
as it works OK, those who did care for the forum enough to express their
opinion did not want to join photo.net.</p>

<p>Far from me is the thought that photo.net is bad. In fact, I have been a
member there since 1996. In 2001, I was one of the first dozen of
members to write specifically a long feature article for the photo.net
site (the photographer&rsquo;s guide to Vietnam) using their format, and I
still contribute regularly to the Forums there. I went to great length
to buy from the photo.net affiliates, even if that meant giving up on
the convenience of my usual suppliers. When I had the impression that
one of those transactions didn&rsquo;t register properly, I alerted photo.net
so they could check. Although I am an active member of photo.net (or
more accurately because) and have no axe to grind against their
management, I could see clearly the differences between photo.net and
the LF page hosted by Lusenet.</p>

<p>The main difference is that the LF page is a not-for-profit online
community, while photo.net is a for-profit company which operate on-line
communities. As such it is difficult for photo.net to have the same
idealistic goals as the LF page. It if often pointed out that photo.net
is in fact not that different, being a non-profitable operation, but I
don&rsquo;t buy this argument for two reasons. First, it was not the intention
of photo.net not to turn out a profit, since otherwise I suppose it
would have been founded as a non-profit. Second, the economy has taught
us that when companies do not turn out a profit, bad things happen to
them, like closing down or being sold to whoever, and this is always a
risk that we must keep in mind.</p>

<p>When someone contributes to the LF page, he can take pride in donating
knowledge in the spirit of giving something back to the large format
community, the very reason for which I created the site myself in the
first place. You can note that the ratio of contributed articles over
community members is maybe one order of magnitude more in the LF page
than in photo.net. It was to encourage that spirit that I didn&rsquo;t want to
even accept donations. When someone contributes to photo.net, he
increases the value of a commercial venture. One of the early strategies
of Philip Greenspun was to create &ldquo;magnet content&rdquo;, somewhat
controversial, but sketchy articles which would compel the readers to
fill-in the gaps by adding comments. Clearly most people wouldn&rsquo;t let a
magazine use their words or images for free, so many people would find
that there is a limit to their contributions to photo.net.</p>

<p>A second problem is that like all companies, photo.net needs to grow to
have credibility and resources. As it grows, it attracts more members
and traffic, and has to cover increasing expenses to satisfy sponsors as
well as members. By contrast, the LF Page just serves ascii text to a
select and relatively small (in 2002, about 1500 people posted a
message, with a couple hundreds posting at least weekly) community and
doesn&rsquo;t need much to support itself, since being a non-mainstream
community, it will always remain of a manageable size. Our server would
enjoy a light load, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to develop more custom
community services.</p>

<p>This resulted in somewhat different communities. The LF community was as
cozy and supportive as it gets. We&rsquo;ve seen members trying to set-up a
network to buy and stock film locally so that one would avoid the hassle
of going through airport security with film. We&rsquo;ve seen a member being
offered a free gear loan after he posted about his gear being stolen
before a trip. Of course, we&rsquo;ve also seen some flame wars, and as a
moderator, I&rsquo;ve had my share of angry emails, but none of this resulted
in the incidents I have witnessed on photo.net such as retaliatory
ratings, or members with excellent records of contributions threatening
to leave, or worse, being banned and denied the right to have their
contributions removed.</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-the-lusenet-area">The end of the Lusenet area</h3>

<p>In December 2001, Philip Greenspun announced that he planned in the
future to discontinue the greenspun.com services. The capabilities
showcased by the system now were commonplace, and nobody was there to
support the servers since he was pushed away from Ars Digita (the
company he founded based on the greenspun.com software, now evolved into
the more sophisticated ACS which is used on photo.net). He suggested
that different Lusenet photo forums be moved to photo.net. As a friend
of mine pointed out, transferring the forums to photo.net would have
been by far the simplest option for me, the one which wouldn&rsquo;t require
me to do anything.</p>

<p>Instead, I asked the community members what they thought of the
different options. This was not meant to be a vote, since one had been
conducted a year and half ago, but rather a discussion meant to put a
finger on key issues. This was not a discussion of a Lusenet-like system
hosted by photo.net versus a Lusenet-like system hosted independently,
since this was the essence of the 2000 discussion, whose result was
clear enough. Rather, I wanted to know whether other alternatives were
acceptable to the community. The main conclusion which emerged from the
discussion was that most people preferred to stay with the current
greenspun.com/ACS interface, a testimony to its excellence. I ruled out
all the options which did not satisfy this requirement. The discussion
also suggested that in the case of a move to photo.net, copyright issues
and the individuality of the Forum had to be preserved.</p>

<p>In light of those conclusions, I asked Philip Greenspun the following:</p>

<pre><code>(a) copyright is independently held by authors and photo.net
(b) each page has a small area at the top or bottom for which 
 I can decide the contents.
(c) no specific 35mm/MF advertising
(d) an option for readers of the LF forum to search only the 
 messages of the LF Forum and not the whole photo.net
</code></pre>

<p>The idea I had in mind was that while the LF contents would be visible
to anyone in photo.net, the rest of photo.net would be visible only to
the LF members who wanted it to be so. Philip agreed to all of those
points (subsequently, the notice which said that photo.net own the
copyright to all the postings was amended) but said that the staff of
photo.net has so much on its plate that it would take maybe a year to
implement some of them. I replied I thought it might not be the best to
move to an overloaded server with overloaded staff which would have no
time to devote to the sub-community issues, whereas our requirements
were quite simple.</p>

<p>I began to explore the feasibility of an independent Lusenet/ACS server.
There were three problems. First, the system, even in its more portable
incarnation, known as OpenACS, would need to run on its own server
because of its requirements of fringe technologies usually not provided
by web hosting companies. This increased the hosting fees by one order
of magnitude, and would require raising funds from members. Although I
would have preferred to avoid it, this was not a major obstacle. Second,
one would have to install OpenACS itself on the system. Third, one would
have to transfer the old archives which are too precious to loose. I had
a look at the software. It appeared to me that the second task would
require a couple of days to a good software developer, while the third
one, while apparently the easiest, would require probably a week, due to
a number of small differences between the two softwares. I am not even a
good software developer myself, so the task appeared over my head. There
were a number of offers (most turned out to be unsuitable after a close
look) but instead of pursuing them in parallel, I chose to accept one
which looked more promising because it would have an OpenACS server
already set-up and running. However, this still did not solve the third
problem (data transfer), and the person who made the offer clearly
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to spend the time required to do it. In light of
the correspondence I&rsquo;ve just had with Brian, who eventually pulled it
off, it seems that my assessment was correct. Anyways, around mid-March
it was clear this was not going to work in the short term, and I left
for a trip in April and the beginning of May. It looked like despite
more frequent outages, the greenspun.com server could still go for a
while, as Philip Greenspun had given no specific deadline. I accept the
blame for not considering the situation with more urgency and failing to
mobilize more effectively the resources of the LF community.</p>

<h3 id="the-move-to-photo-net">The move to photo.net</h3>

<p>On Monday June 3, trying to access the LF forum, I saw that it was
turned off, with a message announcing the move to photo.net. I had been
notified of that only in the evening of Sunday when I didn&rsquo;t check my
email. Philip, before leaving for his trip, requested that the LF Forum
and other photo forums on Lusenet be moved to photo.net. The motivation
of Philip was to preserve the contents of the LF Forum, since he was
going away for a sabbatical, and he was uncertain whether greenspun.com
would still be up in the while. I was not contacted for approval, even
though I had expressed reservations to Philip in the past. Since at that
point there was no alternative, and since it wasn&rsquo;t clear whether
Lusenet would be available in the short term, I resigned myself to the
move.</p>

<p>The fact is that I was not even that opposed to a LF Forum move to
photo.net. There were plenty of opportunities to move to another system
that I could have taken if it was more important for me to prevent the
forum from being taken over by photo.net rather than seeing it served
with a good infrastructure. I was envisioning a move to photo.net by
this summer if no alternative was found.</p>

<p>Then apparently the person who was then in charge of the transfer was
not able to pull it off before his own vacation, and the Forum was
restored for a few days. The aborted move was a wake-up call for a small
group of web developers among the readers of the LF Forum, Bjorn
Nilsson, Josh Wand, and Jennifer Waak. They came up with the idea of
rewriting Lusenet in php/mysql, two popular technologies which would
have made it much more portable and eliminate the hosting problem. This
was good solution for our needs, which do not require the complexity of
the enterprise-class ACS. At about the same time, I received an offer
for a free account with possible root access on a decent server
connected to a T1 line. This was from Brian Reid, an extremely
knowledgeable person who has an history of being generous in helping on
the net non-profit organizations and individuals.</p>

<p>I had resigned myself to the move as the least worse solution for the LF
Forum, but now that we had a promising solution, the situation became
very different. I asked photo.net to delay the move so that we could
finalize the software, evaluate all the possibilities, and get a
consensus on what to do. From my point of view, there was no urgency.
The greenspun.com server, while unreliable, had been somewhat working,
and some insiders acknowledged that it could still be up for a while. In
fact, a year later, it is still running. The data itself was not too
much at risk. After being notified of the possibility of a greenspun.com
shut-down, I had taken the precaution to download it. It is true that
from December 2001 to May 2002 we had not made much progress in finding
a new home, but now development efforts were underway, which would have
made hosting a trivial issue (many \$30/month accounts would now be
appropriate, since we wouldn&rsquo;t need to the OpenACS and its associated
technologies) even if we didn&rsquo;t have our free server. In case of a final
decision to go to an independent server, the move would complicate
things further by confusing the readers, some of which would be lost
during the transitions, confusing the search engines, as well as
introducing new technical difficulties with database updating, and
identification numbers.</p>

<p>However, the photo.net staffers ignored my request. Apparently Brian
Mottershead tried to email me but this email was lost somewhere before
reaching my inbox. Brian (a staffer with long-term financial interests
in photo.net) at that time appeared to sincerely believe that
greenspun.com was to be shut down soon. More importantly, he wanted the
material for photo.net.</p>

<p>Even as the move proceeded, and despite the way it was done without my
consent, or that the members of the lusenet LF community, I was still
willing to cooperate with photo.net enough that I asked the community to
go there at least temporarily. My main concern was to avoid a split
which would loose members along the way. I also didn&rsquo;t want to make an
unnecessary fuss since I appreciated other aspects of photo.net (I
remain an active contributor to other forums to this day).</p>

<h3 id="getting-ready">Getting ready</h3>

<p>However, the nature and tone of Brian&rsquo;s replies in the forum and in
email has convinced me that I should have been more forceful in opposing
the move. While I was troubled by the insistence of Brian to try to
convince everybody forcefully that the forum should stay at photo.net,
using on occasion ad-hominen arguments againt me, what was more of
concern was the fact that Brian was not able to ensure me that photo.net
was not trying to go towards an acquisition.</p>

<p>Several key contributors to the LF forum objected to the takeover by
photo.net, and as a result have withheld or radically reduced their
participation on the LF Forum as it was moved to photo.net.</p>

<p>After Brian had repetedly tried to cast doubt about the legitimacy of
moving over the material previously served by Philip Greenspun to an
independent server, a conversation with Philip Greenspun made it clear
that Philip never considered that he had any licence about the posts,
but rather that they belonged to the LF community. Although the
greenspun.com server that is running Lusenet is still up more than a
year after the move, Philip was worried about it back then. It was only
out of concern for the future of the LF Forum that Philip asked for the
transfer, and he understood very well my concerns about
commercialization, having himself urged that photo.net be transformed
into a not-for-profit entity. Philip made the data transfer easier by
providing us with a direct database listing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although the volunteer efforts had an encouraging start, the
initial progress was slowed down by disagreements amongst the volunteers
developpers on how to code. In the fall, Brian decided that the forum
had taken root on photo.net, and reversed his initial offer to hold a
vote concerning the location of the forum, which put a damp on the
enthusiasm of the developers.</p>

<p>Eventually Bjorn was left alone with the responsability to finish the
software, but he was seriously injured in a car accident. Since he could
not access the internet while recovering at the hospital, nobody could
contact him, and efforts were stalled for many months. What allowed the
software to be completed is that Tom Wesbrook volunteered to finish the
development just at the time when Bjorn got back in touch with us, at
the begining of the summer 2003. This made it possible for Bjorn to
transfer graciously his code to Tom. Within the summer, Tom had finished
the software, and transfered it to the largeformatphotography.info
server.</p>
