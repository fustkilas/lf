<p>I was in Tokyo and I did see the new Toho camera. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s
actually replacing the FC-45A, as I was told by a local shop that they
could get that camera for me in a week. I haven&rsquo;t actually seen the A
model, however.</p>

<p>Here is a description of these cameras, with info. from the brochure.
Keep in mind that I have never used them.</p>

<p>Both the FC-45A and the FC-45X (the new model) seem to use the same
bellows/standards assembly. It&rsquo;s a fixed bellows, attached to the lens
and film standards. To switch between horizontal and vertical format,
you loosen two clamps and simply remove the bellows assembly, rotate it,
and put it back. These two clamps are also used when you shift the
standards.</p>

<p>The main difference between the cameras is in the rails. The FC-45A uses
a one-piece rail, probably of aluminum. The standard rail is 300mm long,
but you can order a 400mm rail too. Bellows extension is listed as 58mm
to 370mm (with long rail); weight is 1.1kg (with short rail?). The
FC-45X uses a telescoping rail. It goes from 236mm when closed to 400 mm
when extended. Bellows extension is listed as 46mm to 364mm; weight is
1.4kg. The FC-45X rail also has a geared focus for the rear standard.
Both cameras feature a folding focusing hood that protects the ground
glass when closed.</p>

<p>Here are the manufacturer&rsquo;s specs for these cameras. Because of the
method of horizontal/vertical format interchange, the rise/fall differs
between the two orientations.</p>

<pre><code>FC-45A              Front       Rear

<p>These cameras use round lensboards. The brochure shows a linhof-type
lensboard mounted at an angle, so presumably you can use a linhof board
with them. Accesories include soft and hard cases. The company also
makes 5X7 and 8X10 cameras; the 4X5 bellows assembly can be used on the
larger cameras&rsquo; rails. Two interesting accessories from Toho are
reducing holders and panorama boards. With the first, you can use a
smaller format film by putting the reducing holder in like a regular
holder and sliding the smaller holder into it. The panorama boards are a
half-darkslide that allow you to put two images on a sheet of film. Toho
also makes a convertible tripod/backpack frame that you can leave the
camera mounted on while hiking (Watch out for low branches!)</p>

<p>I was quite impressed. These cameras are among the lightest of all, yet
they have an adequate rigidity and full monorail features including full
yaw-free movements, the only (weight savings) oddity being the lack of a
reversible back. They allow you to use a good range of focal lengths.
For transport, the belows/standards assembly is detached from the
clamps, resulting in two compact components. Further, the clamps can be
detached from the rail too. A soft case is available for each of the
components.</p>

<p>One possible concern would be wide-angle use. The rear standard assembly
cannot move more than half-way the rail, so there would be some chance
with very wide angle lenses that the rail would show up in the field of
view. This problem can be addressed by buying a short (110m) rail.
However, since there is no wide-angle belows, it is not very clear how
much movement is possible. By playing with the camera I had the
impression that with a 90mm lens the belows compression would limit the
amount of rise below what the camera would allow otherwise. At least the
two standards can be put close together enough that you could use a 47mm
on a flat board and be able to focuss it at infinity.</p>

<p>For a change from black cameras, you can order the FC 45X is six
different bold colors for the rail. By the way, at Yodobashi camera,
which is Tokyo&rsquo;s B&amp;H, they don&rsquo;t stock the camera. It has to be special
ordered two weeks in advance as they claim that even the manufacturer
does not stock it. [Update: As of Oct 99, this camera is imported in
the US by Badger Graphics].</p>

<p>The machining is done with good precision, but somehow I got the
impression that the fact that the camera is produced in small quantities
contributes to maintain a price tag that I find a bit high (List
Y180000, around Y150000 at Yodobashi). As of Apr 99, the FC-45A seems to
have been discontinued.</p>

<p>The FA camera was first reviewed in Shutterbug, January 1995 by Roger
Hicks, and at that time was extremely hard to obtain. You had to order
in Japan.</p>
