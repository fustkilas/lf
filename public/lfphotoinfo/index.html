<p>Why move to largeformatphotography.info (lfphoto.info) ?</p>

<h2 id="why-move-to-largeformatphotography-info-lfphoto-info">Why move to largeformatphotography.info (lfphoto.info) ?</h2>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/">Q.-Tuan Luong</a> for
<a href=".">largeformatphotography.info</a>, Sept 2003.</strong></p>

<p><em>Summary</em>: In June 2002, the LF forum was moved to photo.net. As the
person who created and helped made this forum a success, I have given my
<a href="lf-photonet.html">personal perspective on that move</a>. In this document,
I will not dwelve on the past, but instead explain why I think that for
the best long-term chances of success, the LF Forum should continue on
largeformatphotography.info (lfphoto.info). It is my opinion that there
is no technical advantage in having the forum at photo.net, as it would
work better on largeformatphotography.info. On the other hand, many
regular contributors have expressed concerns about intellectual
property, commercialization, and the long term future of photo.net. A
number of them have withheld or radically reduced their participation on
the LF Forum as it was moved to photo.net. Based on the information that
I have, I can confirm those concerns. We have now a very real
possibility to operate a non-commercial LF site. I strongly suggest that
for the benefit of this community as a whole, we all continue our
discussions on largeformatphotography.info instead of photo.net.</p>

<h3 id="lfphoto-info-works-as-well-as-or-better-than-photo-net">lfphoto.info works as well as, or better than photo.net</h3>

<p>For most people, what really matters is to have a site that works well
for posting and reading messages. It is my belief that the Forum on
largeformatphotography.info will be a technical improvement on
photo.net, because of better functionality, long term stability,
performance, ease of search, data integrity, and support.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: lfphoto.info runs software especially designed to
closely replicate the greenspun.com/photo.net interface you are all
familiar with, and adds several improvements. These improvements
include a user-management system that protects email addresses, yet
do not require registration, user history, display of the whole
thread while replying, and several important improvements on the
admin side. They allow the lfphoto.info forum software to match or
exceed photo.net&rsquo;s forums functionalities.</li>
<li><strong>Long term stability</strong>: lfphoto.info runs from a server donated by
a person with an important position in the internet industry, who is
committed to helping non-profits, and has a long record of
contributions to Usenet (in the non-commercial days of the internet
whose values lfphoto.info is trying to preserve). Because it uses
the very popular Php/mysql technologies the LF Forum could be moved
easily to another server if needed, including QT Luong&rsquo;s, which has
plenty of bandwidth to spare. Beyond the programming (now finished
!) and moderation, lfphoto.info does not require a single dollar to
operate. As a matter of fact, I have never asked for financial
contributions, and have turned down quite a few ones. All this makes
lfphoto.info the healthiest long term location for the forum.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: The photo.net server is often overloaded, with more
than 1 million unique visitors per month and lots of image activity,
which is now the main focus of the site. There have been repeated
complaints about various photo.net posting problems which didn&rsquo;t
seem to occur in greenspun.com. People also found greenspun.com to
have better performance (when not down). lfphoto.info will have two
orders of magnitude less users and serve mostly text files, all from
a competent server with a fast and stable internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of search</strong>: On photo.net, you cannot search the archives
just for LF contents, and you cannot search the valuable static
contents oflfphoto.info (which is not part of photo.net). On
lfphoto.info, you will be able to search all the LF contents
exclusively (static page and Forum). Using Google to do so will be
effective since everything relevant is just under our domain name.
More generally, lfphoto.info will be a community of LF participants
supporting a multiplicity of LF resources, the forum, the technical
reviews, the lens related information, etc. Having the forum at
lfphoto.info would offer the best possibility of improving all the
LF related resources there. For instance, new forum software could
made it possible to automatically link to a location where
participants could offer suggestions for new articles, or contribute
to existing articles, facilitate the creation of an extensive list
of FAQs, etc&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Data integrity</strong>: The database of older postings of the LF Forum
at photo.net has problems (such as misattributed postings, missing
postings, and inconsistent links) and we don&rsquo;t know how extensive
the problems are. The database of older postings on lfphoto.info
just replicates that of greenspun.com. This database was directly
copied from lusenet with the permission and help of Philip
Greenspun, the author and owner of lusenet. It comprises more than
60000 postings.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>: Our volunteers concentrate their efforts exclusively on
lfphoto.info. On the other hand, photo.net has not been responsive
to solving obvious problems in the LF database, like having large
positive counts in empty categories, and not being able to delete
categories that are no longer needed. Recently, the email alerts
quit working, and photo.net has not been able to fix the problems
yet. The photo.net management seems to have identified other areas
as more critical to their revenue generation. As of this writting,
we have both Tom and Bjorn onboard to fix technical problems and
make improvements. It is expected that as the Forum picks up
momentum again, some others might join.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-can-be-said-for-photo-net">What can be said for photo.net ?</h3>

<p>Staying at photo.net is the conservative solution. I am aware that there
is a bit of uncertainty involved in moving to lfphoto.info. However,
based on my knowledge of the situation, I think it is well worth taking
the risk. The forum is best off at an independent site with people who
care about large format photography.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>photo.net is here to stay.</strong> I have already outlined why I think
that the lfphoto.info has a good long term stability. In its current
set-up, it could go on forever with just a minimal amount of
volunteer admin efforts, requiring absolutely no funds. While
photo.net is most likely to be around for a long time, it is not
certain at all who the owners will be, and how they will manage it.
Changes can happen overnight. Currently photo.net is barely
profitable, so either commercialization has to be increased, or it
will have to be sold.</li>
<li><strong>We are already at photo.net.</strong> We have not elected to be at
photo.net. In fact, the greenspun.com server is still running one
year after the move to photo.net, and if not for the photo.net
forcing the move on us, we would just be quietly moving to our new
server without any fuss. It is possible that another move would
divide the community further, but to begin with, the community has
already been divided with many staying away from photo.net. Moving
to the new server is the normal course of action we would have
taken, and is an opportunity to reunite the community. The more we
stay at photo.net, the more divisive the move will be. It is better
to do it as soon as possible, now.</li>
<li><strong>We would have the opportunity to educate more new participants at
photo.net.</strong> The same effect would be easily obtained with a direct
link from photo.net. The only thing missing would be the &ldquo;unified
forum view&rdquo; that I think is clunky anyways. The LF site was very
visible through search engines (Google #1 for &ldquo;large format
photography&rdquo;) and will now be even more visible, while the LF Forum
is buried in that mass-market entity photo.net. Any motivated
photo.net members who seek LF education from the community&rsquo;s experts
will find lfphoto.info, even if photo.net declines putting up a link
to us. While it is true that the original charter of photo.net, as
envisioned by Philip, was education, things have been changing there
(and much to Philip&rsquo;s displeasure).</li>
</ul>

<p>The following reasons hold no weight in my opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Many LF users are photo.net members</strong>. Surfing to lfphoto.info is
as easy as surfing to the LF Forum on photo.net. Most of the people
who prefer lfphoto.info (including myself and the developers) are
photo.net members. We recognize that photo.net has value, otherwise
we wouldn&rsquo;t be members there, but lfphoto.info is better. Lacking a
willing wealthy benefactor, it is likely impossible to operate a
community as large as photo.net in a non-commercial way, but it is
possible to do so for the LF community, so why not do it ?</li>
<li><strong>Brian did a lot of work in migrating the forum</strong>. This must be
acknowledged, however if Brian had asked before proceeding to do the
migration, all this would not have happened. The LF developers
(Bjorn Nilsson, Tom Westbrook, and a few others) have spent much
more effort than Brian, since not only they migrated the forum, but
also they wrote from scratch the new Forum software. Unlike Brian
who is a photo.net employee, they have absolutely no financial
interest in the outcome, as lfphoto.info is purely non-commercial,
and did all their work in the spirit of sharing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="issues-with-photo-net">Issues with photo.net</h3>

<p>A number of key contributors to the old LF Forum are conspicuous in
their absence on photo.net. It is highly likely that those contributors
will participate again on an independent Forum. Some of them have
explicitly announced their reticence to posting on photo.net because
they prefer not to give a perpetual license to some as-yet unidentified
commercial enterprise in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial v. non-profit.</strong> There <em>is</em> a difference in ethos, which
translates into several consequences.</p>

<ul>
<li>When someone contributes to the LF page, (s)he can take pride in
donating knowledge back to the large format community, in the spirit
of the generosity of the early days of the internet. When someone
contributes to photo.net, (s)he also increases the value of a
commercial venture. Some readers (including key contributors) are
uncomfortable with their contributions to their own community being
used to forward a commercial venture.</li>
<li>The lfphoto.info is run as democratically as possible, placing
priority on the interests of its members. As an illustration, I
proposed a vote on the location of the LF Forum, a proposition that
was eventually refused by Brian Mottershead, although he was
initially favorable to it. Only the few photo.net shareholders will
have a say if the company is sold. More concretely, recently
participants appear to be favorable to worshop announcements on the
Forum, but this was not permitted by photo.net.</li>
<li>The charter of largeformatphotography.info is to be the site of the
LF community. A commercial site places its efforts where most of the
money is. As a result, the needs of minority sub-communities become
secondary, as shown by the lack of attention to several technical
issues on the forums.</li>
<li>A site relying heavily on commercial sponsors inevitably loses its
objectivity.</li>
<li>The photo.net site is blocked by network administrators at several
large organizations.</li>
<li>As a grassroots group, it is easier for us to seek contributions for
the site from outside sources, as well as to get people to volunteer
their time to help.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Copyright</strong>. On photo.net, you &ldquo;grant photo.net a perpetual
non-exclusive world-wide royalty-free license to modify, publish and
reproduce that material for the purpose of operating, displaying,
distributing and promoting photo.net&rdquo;. It has been pointed to that as it
reads in a court of law this is virtually an unlimited license. Another
owner could exploit their licence to whatever degree desired. The terms
of use on lfphoto.info make it clear that lfphoto.net doesn&rsquo;t claim any
right beyond a revokable licence to publish on its site, and will remove
on request any of the contents you posted.</p>

<p><strong>Community focus</strong>. While the initial focus of photo.net was education,
it is now trying to be a mass site which favors quantity over quality
(as noticed by many photo.net old-timers, some of them moderators) in
order to be financially profitable. The main efforts are directed
towards areas such as the image gallery and its rating system.
photo.net&rsquo;s title page nowadays reads &ldquo;Photo.net home page and recent
digital cameras reviews&rdquo;. The LF community has little in common with the
typical photo.net reader nowadays, and is best served on its own site,
one ran by people who care about Large Format Photography.</p>

<p><strong>The future</strong>. Photo.net as a corporation is a commodity subject to
acquisition. While the current officers and management seem to be of
good will, there is no such guarantee down the line. Why should we take
the chance, knowing that if we wait it would be much more difficult to
move than now ?</p>

<p><strong>We have given photo.net a chance</strong>. One year ago, despite dubious way
photo.net had taken over the site, I initially asked the community to
move there to see how it would work. The net result is that the forum
has not improved, with many thinking it has in fact degraded. A distinct
increase in amateurish behavior can be seen, but the main reason why the
discussions have dropped in quality is that we have lost many valuable
contributors on the way.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>We now have a very real possibility to have a non-commercial LF site
with a Forum software which matches or betters the photo.net LF forum.
The independent, non-commercial nature should satisfy those who have
issues with the commercial nature of photo.net. The renewed community
focus on Large Format Photography, integration with other LF resources,
and hopefully reuniting of the former community on greenspun.com, should
satisfy everyone.</p>
