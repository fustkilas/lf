<h3 id="general-information">General information</h3>

<p>LF lenses come two ways, ready mounted in a shuter and in barrels with a
diaphragm but no shutter. The barrel mounted ones are intended to be
used with an external, usually rear mounted shutter. This can be
anything from a lens cap (or derby hat in the wet plate days) to the
quite complicated Sinar shutter. The most commonly used rear shutter is
the one made by Packard, a simple air operated shutter with single speed
(aroung <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> sec.) and time. Some of these come with a synch contact.
These work nicely for strobe on the studio. When a lens comes already in
a shutter you get whatever the manufacturer offered at the time the
thing was built. Samaller lense typically are in German made Compur
shutters, probably the most widely used high quality shutter ever made.
Larger lenses will come in Compound or Ilex shutters. Newer lenses come
in Copal shutters, which are essentially a Japanese version of the
Compur with, perhaps, some improvements. It is really not a matter or
choice except that the shutter should be in good condition. Its possible
to remount old lenses in new shutters but its expensive (the shutters
are expensive) and isn&rsquo;t worth doing unless the lens is something
exceptional. <strong>Richard Knoppow</strong></p>

<p>If you want to learn a lot about shutters (but NOT ENOUGH to fix one),
try to find a copy of L.P.Clerc&rsquo;s &ldquo;Photography Theory And Practice&rdquo;,
Focal Press, 1973 edition. Chapter XVII is all about Shutters (pages
236-271 of that edition). <strong>Jean-David Beyer</strong></p>

<p>Linhof invented the shutter in the last century. He split with Deckel
and started to make cameras only. Deckel sold the shutter business to
Zeiss many decades ago. They put it in the Prontor factory. Deckel went
bankrupt in 1995. <strong>BobS</strong></p>

<h3 id="some-older-shutters">Some older shutters</h3>

<p><strong>by <a href="mailto:dickburk@ix.netcom.com">Richard Knoppow</a></strong></p>

<p>A partial listing of shutters you will encounter on old lenses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compur, a gear-train controlled, high quality shutter. One with a
small dial for steeing the dpeed wre made before 1931. Those with a
ring to set the speed were after 1931. Ther were many variations of
the shutter. These are the most common good quality shutter.</li>
<li>Compound, An air-brake controlled shutter. Smaller ones are usually
quite old the largest size was made until the mid 1960&rsquo;s. Quite
reliable if clean.</li>
<li>Ilex, made shuters for professional lenses. The Acme is a cocking
type shutter the Universal is a self-setting shutter. All used
gear-train regulation (Ilex held the original patent on this). They
are meant to run witout lubrication and get irregular when
lubracated. The #5 Universal was the largest commonly available
shutter. Its top speed is about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> sec whatever the marking says
and they need to be excercized a couple of times before making an
exposure to ensure uniformity. The construction is about the same as
a cheap alarm clock. Very common on LF lenses.</li>
<li>Wollensak, Various names. Wollensak&rsquo;s original business was shutters
and they made good ones. Not seen as often as some other. IMHO they
are as good as Compur.</li>
<li>Kodak Supermatic. Found on small and medium format Kodak lenses.
Very rugged reliable shutters. Slow speeds are accurate. Most will
have worn main springs so the fastest speeds will be about half of
marked. New springs should fix this but I don&rsquo;t know of a source.
These shutters can be cleaned without disassembley because the gear
train is exposed when the lens cells are removed.</li>
<li>Copal shutters are found on modern LF lenses and sometimes old lense
that have been remounted. More accurate than the older shutters but
still spring motor driven.</li>
<li>Packard shutters are a simple three-flap air driven devise. They are
life savers for barrel mounted lenses and are still made. New ones
cost about \$80 US for plain and \$125 for flash synch type. These
are not found on lenses but are used separately mounted on the back
of the lensboard. Unse ones were very common a few years ago but the
supply seems to have dried up.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-they-work">How they work</h4>

<p>There are pretty good illustrations in some of the older photography
handbooks so a trip to the library is indicated. In general, most leaf
shutters are completly mechanical. There have been some designs using
electric motors to drive the blades but they have never caught on
perhaps because of the need for batteries. The typical shutter is driven
by a spring motor. Both helical springs (like a screen door spring) and
spiral springs (like a clock spring) have been widely used. Some large
shutters also use wire coiled springs. The shutter blades are
approximately triangularly shaped. One apex can rotate on a fixed pin
connected to the body of the shutter, an opposite apex is connected to a
pin on a roatating blade ring. As the ring rotates it moves the blades
together or apart. The blade ring is driven by the spring motor. With
single action shutters which must be cocked, the cocking action winds or
tensions the drive spring. When the shutter is released the spring
operates a lever which drives the shutter blades open, it then continues
to move a lever which bears on a retarding mechanism. In most shutters
made since about 1920, this retarder consists of a clock-work
escapement. This retarder keeps the shutter open for a specified time,
while it operates and then releases the drive lever so that the main
spring can drive the blades closed again. The idea is to open and close
the blades as quickly as possible to maximize the efficiency of the
shutter. The retarder is adjustable, that&rsquo;s what the speed setting dial
does, usually by means of a cam of some sort which limits the distance
the retarder is in control of the release lever. Some older types of
shutters have an air brake instead of the clock-work. The Dekel Compound
is one of these. Compounds were made for at least sixty years and are
surprizingly accurate. Some shutters, particularly inexpensive ones, and
some very large ones, (Ilex Universal) are &ldquo;double action&rdquo; or
self-cocking. That means the shutter fires each time the release is
pushed whith out having to cock it with a separate lever. This limits
the strength of the motor somewhat so that double-action shutters do not
have high top speeds. The release lever does the cocking at you operate
it to make the exposure. Just as a double action revolver takes a much
harder trigger pull than a single action, the double action shutter
requires much more force to trip because you are also winding it. As
shutters age the speeds often become slower. The slower speeds slow down
because of gumming of the lubricant in the retarder clock-work, cleaning
will bring them back. At higher speeds the trouble can also be dirt
generally increasing the friction, or a drive spring which has become
fatigued with use, or both. Often a proper cleaning wil bring the higher
speeds back. Shutters must be very clean to operate properly. Also the
correct lubricants must be used where lubrication is called for.
Typically, very light watch oil is used on retarders and very light
MolyKote grease used on sliding parts. Some shutters (Ilex and some
others) are intended to run without lubricant and will have irregular
speeds if lubricated. The highest speeds of most shutters are calibrated
with the assumption that the iris will be wide open. That means the
shutter is operating at minimum efficiency. Typically, the actual total
open time, as measured by a speed meter will be 15% to 30% slower than
the marked speed. The speed spec for late model Synchro Compur shutters
require that the top speed of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub> measure something like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>350</sub> to be
in spec. Slower speeds are usually more accurate. There have been many
designs of leaf shutters over the years. Some older ones had double
leafs which rotated completely around and then rotated back the other
way the next time the shutter was tripped (Wollensak Optimo). Some
shutters use the same leafs for both diaphragm and shutter, opening only
to the specified f/stopm (Bausch &amp; Lomb Volute). This arrangement is
used in some modern automatic exposure control cameras. But most
between-the-lens shutters operate as described above. The best
illustrations I know of are all in rather old books. Check for C.B.
Neblette&rsquo;s _Handbook of Photography_ or the even older Henney and
Dudley book of the same name. Your library should be able to get them
through inter library loan if they don&rsquo;t have them. A couple of pictures
will make things much clearer.</p>

<h3 id="packard-shutters">Packard Shutters</h3>

<p><strong>by <a href="mailto:dickburk@ix.netcom.com">Richard Knoppow</a></strong></p>

<p>Packard shutters go back to the 1890&rsquo;s. Most of them are air operated,
the shutter being operated by an air cylinder on the back of the shutter
and actuated by squeezing an air-bulb connected by a rubber hose. Three
versions of Packards were made: The first has only &ldquo;bulb&rdquo; exposure, i.e.
stays open until you close it, the second has a pin that selects between
bulb and instantaneous ( about 1/20sec) exposure and the third kind has
two bulbs, one for B and one for I. Some shutters of the last two kinds
have contacts for syncronizing flash. I have occasionally seen other
versions with a solenoid instead of the air cylindar for driving the
shutter.</p>

<p>The Packard can be mounted either in back or in front of the lens. The
most typical use is to mount the shutter on the back of a lens board
with the air hose brought out through either a hole or a fitting going
through to the front. The shutter is held in place with four wood
screws, very simple. Some Packard shutters offer either bulb or
instantaneous exposure controlled by a pin which projects through the
front of the lens board. when the pin is pulled out, the shutter is
opened by squeezing the bulb and stays open until the blades are sucked
back with the same bulb. In instantaneous the pin is pushed in. When the
bulb is squeezed a toggle arrangement pushes against the pin and the
shutter opens and closes with the same squeeze. Maximum shutter speed is
dependant on how hard you squeeze but practically is about 1/20th sec,
also dependant on the size of the shutter. Packard shutters can also be
mounted on the front of a lens by means of a baffle and clamp. None are
sold commercially but the design will be obvious when looking at a
shutter. The electric shutters have more consistant speed but are more
expensive.</p>

<p>Packard shutters are limited in what they can do but are very much
cheaper than a standard shutter and the cost of re-mounting a lens. For
a great many purposes they work just fine. Its possible to mount a
Packard on lens board which is fitted to take lenses in smaller boards
or with an iris-diaphragm lens holder. That way any number of lenses can
be used on same shutter. Packard shutters can be made in very large
sizes and are often the only practical way to have a shutter for some
lenses (e.g. the 16&rdquo; Kodak Portrait lens). The largest stock unit has a
clearance of 7&rdquo;. Packard shutters are still made. They are avaiable
from:</p>

<pre><code>Professional Photographic Products Inc.

Hammonton, NJ, 08037-0169

<p>Packard is still in business. The number is 800 257 8541</p>

<p>[R. Miller: see also <a href="http://www.equinoxphotographic.com">Equinox
Photographic</a> They used to stock
them, but as of <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>2005</sub> seldom have them. ]</p>

<p>They will send you a free catalogue which includes replacement parts for
old shutters. Typical prices are along these lines No.6 (T&amp;I)shutter 3&rdquo;
opening, \$102 without synch,\$137 with synch. Used packards are getting
hard to find. I used to buy them for \$10 or \$20 for non-synch ones.
Its pretty easy to makeshift a synch using a microswitch mounted on the
back of the lens board and actuated by the air cylinder.</p>

<p><strong>By <a href="mailto:dionj@netcom.com">Dion Johnson</a></strong></p>

<p>Packard shutters are self cocking. Generally, they have two operation
modes - B and I. The I &ldquo;instantaneous&rdquo; setting causes the shutter to
both open and close with one squeeze of the bulb. The speed varies on
how hard you squeeze the bulb, how flexible is your rubber tubing, and
how big is the shutter. It&rsquo;s difficult to get enough consistency to feel
confident of exposing your color transparency film with one of these.
The B vs I operation is usually accomplished by inserting a approx .060&rdquo;
pin into the mechanism, which causes the final part of the travel of the
piston to close the shutter. In original configuration, this little pin
mounts in a small bushing and has stops when it slides in and out of the
hole. Typically, the air hose, and this pin extend out to the front of
the lensboard. They come in many sizes from about 3x3&rdquo; up to 6x6&rdquo;, maybe
more. They are very easy to clean and refurbish, and tend to give long
service. They respond well to graphite and silicone. Usually, the
Packard shutter has black felt on its front surface, and mounts to the
back of your camera&rsquo;s front standard with 4 screws, just smaller than
the bellows frame. Some Packard shutters have flash sync&hellip; it&rsquo;s very
easy to add this with a momentary microswitch if you are handy. Just
mount the microswitch inside the Packard metal housing so it is tripped
when the shutter is wide open. It&rsquo;s feasible to mount a Packard shutter
in front of your lens&hellip; you need a slip-on flat plate to hold the
shutter, something like an overgrown Cokin filter adapter. Of course, if
you are going to mount something in front, why not go ahead and get a
more modern, real shutter and stick it on there.</p>

<p><strong>by Bob Salomon</strong></p>

<p>As to the difference between a Copal and a Compur shutter: Compur has
1/3rd step click stops on the aperture, Copal has none. Compur has a
stop at the end of the aperture scale, Copal does not. Compur can add an
aperture setting device to allow setting the aperture from behind the
camera. Compur does not. The Compur may have a faster top speed
depending on the shutter size. As to pricing the Compur is more than 2x
the price of the Copal so, in some sizes, it may double the price of a
lens. Also available for current lenses are the Rollei Linear Motor
shutter for view camera lenses, the Horseman ISS shutter, the Noblex
shutter and the Sinar shutter. The most common ones are the Copal,
Compur and the Prontor Professional.</p>

<p>Copal 0 = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub>, no aperture click stops, no remote aperture
control<br />
Copal 1 = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>400</sub>, no aperture click stops, no remote aperture
control<br />
Copal 3 = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>125</sub>, no aperture click stops, no remote aperture
control</p>

<p>Compur 0 = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> stop aperture click stops, no remote
aperture control<br />
Compur 1 = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> stop aperture click stops, remote
aperture control available<br />
Compur 3 = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>250</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> stop aperture click stops, remote
aperture control<br />
(Remote control units for the aperture allow swtting the aperture from
behind the lens).</p>

<p>Prontor Professional 01S = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>250</sub>, disengageable <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> stop
aperture click stops, remote aperture control, remote shutter control<br />
Prontor Professional 1S = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>250</sub>, disengageable <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> stop
aperture click stops, remote aperture control, remote shutter control<br />
Prontor Professional 3S = 1 sec. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>125</sub>, disengageable <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> stop
aperture click stops, remote aperture control, remote shutter control<br />
(On the Prontor professional, with its accessory remotes, aperture and
shutter speed can be set from behind the camera, the shutter can be
opened to taking aperture to check DOF, open aperture for focusing and
closed down to taking aperture with shutter closed for firing the
shutter. The cable release can be attached directly to the remote
control unit.)</p>

<p>Today the thread size for the lens cells of all 0, 01, 1, 3 shutters
from Copal, Compur, Prontor, Noble, Horseman, Rollei and Seiko are
identical as are the thread sizes to attach them to the lens boards. Old
shutters from various manufacturers varied the sizes but today they are
standardized as are the lens cell thread sizes.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This refers specifically to Copals. Post WWII Compurs are the same
except for tolerances concerning the front to rear lens cell flanges
distance (anyhow measured shutters show that practical manufacturing
tolerances are much smaller than specs). Prontor shutters are also the
same except that there is a &ldquo;01&rdquo; size which is an hybrid of &ldquo;0&rdquo; lens
cells and &ldquo;1&rdquo; flange mount. Finally I left over all exotic sizes as
&ldquo;00&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo; and &ldquo;5&rdquo; as those came (as prewar &ldquo;0&rdquo;, &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;3&rdquo;
shutters) in a variety of thickness, diameters and threads.</p>

<p>Well, I have not conducted tests on those Prontor shutters so I could
not tell you if they are more precise than the Copals. They seem quite
well made though. What is sure however is that they offer some unusual
features like :</p>

<ul>
<li>a/ being self cocking (a plus or a minus depending of the kind of
work you do as this imposes a quite long movement to first cock the
shutter and only after release it).</li>
<li>b/ having a second cable release like socket which commands opening
of the shutter to full aperture (automatic preset diaphragm) and
opening the shutter blades. You may see it as indulging lazyness
(going from back to front of the camera) but it may also increase
consistency of the aperture setting when working.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also buy a nice system with a command box and two cable releases
to automate all this but the price is a bit extreme &hellip;</p>

<p>Prontor-Werk Alfred Gauthier GmbH is a company of the Zeiss Group. They
make shutters, accessories and cable releases for photographic or
industrial use under the brand Prontor as well as shutters and
accessories under the brand Compur. The current address in Germany is:</p>

<p><strong>Comments on the Prontor by Tuan</strong></p>

<p><em>Update: The Prontor Professional was discountinued in 2001.</em></p>

<p>With a self-cocking shutter, when you are making multiple exposures, you
might be able to avoid touching the camera (that&rsquo;s assuming you use same
f-stop and speed), resulting in a better chance to get a perfect
registration. This is often done in architectural photography for
instance, in order to mix lights. Another advantage of having a
self-cocking shutter is when you have these odd exposures of 2 or 3
seconds, where it is somewhat difficult to time with good repeatability.
you can just do several times 1 second.</p>

<p>The use of the remote control is optional. Otherwise, the Prontor needs
two ordinary cable releases. Those cable releases need to be equiped
with the ability to lock them at a position, otherwise critical
functions are difficult to perform. One is used like on any other
shutter. The other is used to switch between the different shutter
modes: open full aperture, open real aperture, closed. This is similar
to the switch on the Copal, except that the Copal provides only
open/closed.</p>

<p>I used to have a Prontor on my 110. I liked the ability to time
precisely and repetitively 2-3 second exposures, as well as the
possibility to switch instantly between having the lens opened at full
aperture, opened and stopped down, and closed ready for shooting.</p>

<p>However, I think those advantages are outweighted by the drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because the lens is stopped down &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; instead of manually
for a copal, if for some reason the aperture blades are stuck, you
won&rsquo;t necessarily notice it until it is too late, ruining many
exposures (I lost more than 70 sheets of film total).</li>
<li>There is no T setting. To stop down and maintain the lens open to
check dof, since you need to have the secondary release depressed
mid-way to do so. So you have to rely on a proper (with locking
positions) second cable release for critical functions. This second
cable release gets in the way when trying to pack compactly.</li>
<li>The shutter is more vibration prone, because you need to press the
cable release with some force.</li>
<li>Having a mix of copals and prontors could be somewhat confusing.</li>
<li>With my particular lens, the front scales are particularly difficult
to read, while the scale on top of the lens is too high.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I found that while the Prontor was very nice to operate,
it was not simple and reliable enough for use in the field. As my
Prontor became rusted, I eventually got my 110 remounted in a Copal.</p>
