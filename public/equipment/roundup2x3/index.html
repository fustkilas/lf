<p>2x3 Cameras: a round-up</p>

<h2 id="2x3-cameras-a-round-up">2x3 Cameras : a round-up</h2>

<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/">Q.-Tuan Luong</a> for <a href=".">the Large
Format Page</a></strong></p>

<p><em>Summary: a discussion of the 2x3 format, and a survey of 2x3 field and
view cameras arranged by category and prices.</em></p>

<p>This survey is about cameras of 2x3 format which operate like 4x5 and
larger view/field cameras, with bellows, movements, and ground glass.
Although technically those cameras are Medium Format, the techniques and
mindset that are required to use them make them an integral part of the
Large Format photography experience.</p>

<p>Some of the cameras described here are just scaled-down version of a
4x5, so look at the <a href="roundup4x5.html">4x5 round-up</a> for more details and
links which are omitted here.</p>

<h3 id="advantages-of-2x3">Advantages of 2x3</h3>

<ul>
<li>Film is cheaper, available in a wider variety of emulsions, and
easier to handle.</li>
<li>In color, up to 16x20 (20x24 if using digital printing), differences
with 4x5 are barely noticeable.</li>
<li>More digital backs are available to fit 2x3 than 4x5 (the latter
often don&rsquo;t make use of the full format).</li>
<li>Better portability: you save some weight and size with a 2x3. The
reduced size makes the camera less prone to vibration in the wind.</li>
<li>It is easier to use a binocular viewer on a 2x3.</li>
<li>Because of the smaller magnification, you gain about fstops (maybe 1
or 2) for equivalent DOF than a 4x5, therefore faster shutter speeds
on windy days.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="drawbacks-of-2x3">Drawbacks of 2x3</h3>

<ul>
<li>Because you start with a smaller piece of film, you need to have the
best lenses and roll-film backs, excellent ground-glass
registration, as well as an impeccable technique.</li>
<li>In general, a 2x3 camera weights about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the weight of the
equivalent 4x5. However, the film area is less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> (if you use
6x7, it is only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>). Most 2x3 cameras are more heavy than the
lightweight 4x5.</li>
<li>The image&rsquo;s smaller size makes movements harder to see &amp; interpret
than on 4x5, and the movements themselves are smaller.</li>
<li>A 4x5 with a roll-film back lets you shoot roll-film as well,
including the 6x12 panoramic format that you cannot do with a 2x3.</li>
<li>For B&amp;W, if you use the Zone system, you don&rsquo;t have as much
flexibility in processing as with sheet film, since you&rsquo;d have to
carry one roll-film back for each possible development.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flatbed-field-technical-cameras">Flatbed/Field/Technical cameras</h3>

<ul>
<li>Older cameras: <strong>Speed/Crown Graphic 23</strong>, <strong>6x9 Busch Pressman</strong>,
have limited movements on front only, and were designed to be
hand-holdable.</li>
<li><strong>Tachihara Shirom 69 field</strong>: distributed by Adorama, it is an
horizontal camera (you&rsquo;d have to turn it on its side to shoot
verticals). I&rsquo;d be wary of the inexpensive wooden construction since
on such a format alignment precision is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Horseman VH</strong>: metal (but overall built and quality of materials
not as good as Linhof). single extension: 65mm-250mm belows. all
moves on front, movements possible with shorter extensions than the
Technika (but still not very easy). technical back (swing/tilts by
Technika-style rods). Revolving graflok back, extension to 4x5
possible. 1.7kg (\$2400). <strong>Horseman VHR</strong>(2.0kg) adds a
superstructure with rangefinder (and related attachments, usable
only with Horseman lenses 65mm-180mm) combined with a confusing
vertical/horizontal viewfinder. This is the only difference with the
VH. <strong>Horseman 985,980</strong> older models with no revolving back. The
horizontal viewfinder is separate from rangefinder. <strong>Horseman ER
1</strong> adds to the VHR some electric controls and locks designed to
make handholding operation easier and faster.</li>
<li><strong>Ebony SV 23</strong>: Camera with high quality ebony/titanium
construction. All movements with traditional field camera geometry.
52-500mm (huge triple bellows extension, but interchangeable and
flexible enough for wide angle lenses). 1.8kg. (\$3400)</li>
<li><strong><a href="linhof/technika-23.html">Linhof Technika IV</a></strong>: Extremely well
built and solid. all moves in front, technical back, combined
rangefinder and viewfinder. Not so good for wide angle use. <strong>Linhof
Technika V</strong> rangefinder on side and accessory viewfinder (like all
the 4x5 models), better front movements, flipping panel helps for
rise. 48-300mm extension. 1.8kg (\$3800)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="monorail-non-folding-cameras">Monorail/Non folding cameras</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>6x9 Plaubel Peco Jr</strong> is a monorail with rise/fall and shift on
the front, and swing, tilt on the rear</li>
<li><strong><a href="cameras/toyo/toyo-galvin-2x3.html">Galvin</a>:</strong> Used to be hand
built by camera repairman Jim Galvin (hence rougher than the modern
machine built cameras), and lack geared movements. Their main
strength is the size and weight: 1.2kg (used \$300-\$700)</li>
<li><strong>Gowland Pocket view</strong> 2x3 (250mm of extension) and 4x5 cost and
weight the same, 1.1kg for the camera with front moves only (\$725)
1.35kg with back tilt and reversible back (\$850) (note that
although this is the lightest 2x3, it&rsquo;s weight is still comparable
to that of the Toho 45).</li>
<li><strong>Cambo SC I</strong>: scaled down Calumet 45NX, monorail, all moves.</li>
<li><strong>Cambo 23 SF</strong>: scaled down Cambo 45 SF. 25-200mm of extension.
monorail, all moves. part of a system and can be upgraded to 4x5.
4kg.</li>
<li><strong><a href="cameras/toyo/toyo-galvin-2x3.html">Toyo 23G</a></strong>: scaled down Toyo
45G. monorail, all moves. 4kg (used \$850-\$1450)</li>
<li><strong>Ebony SW23</strong>: non-folding wide-angle camera with the
ebony/titanium construction. all movements on front. 46-157mm of
extension, 1.3kg. (\$2300)</li>
<li><strong><a href="arca23.html">Arca Swiss 69FC</a></strong>: Very functionnal, precise and
well built cameras, with a Swiss high quality feeling. Yaw-free.
Relatively light and compact for a monorail. 42-200mm extension. 2.5
kg. (\$2400) Also available in 2x3 are the <strong>Metric</strong> and
<strong>Monolith</strong> lines. All are part of a system and can be upgraded to
4x5.</li>
<li><strong>Ebony 23S</strong>: non-folding camera with the ebony/titanium
construction. all movements on front and back, 65-275mm of
extension, 1.8kg. (\$2700).</li>
<li><strong>Technikardan 69</strong> Telescoping monorail with an unique mechanical
design allow the camera to be collapsed instantly to book-size.
Folds the smallest for a monorail. High german quality feeling.
Better in the field (excellent portability) than in the studio
(particular to operate and not modular). extension: 48-340mm . 2.8kg
(\$2900)</li>
<li><strong>Linhof M679</strong>: designed with the digital studio in mind, it and
comes out of the box with no means of viewing or using film. Geared
swings and tilts, but no shift or rises on the original model (It
has been replaced by the <strong>M679cc</strong> which has rear rise and shift,
\$3300) Integrated ball head (comparable to a Profi III), which
makes the weight look more reasonable. 3.8kg.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Cambo SC I: To my surprise, you can buy one new from Calumet as a
special order. I&rsquo;d rather buy Toyo 23G view at that price, though. The
latter is also a special-order item, I think. Really the same as
current-model Calumet 45NX except the size. Focusing knobs are
exceptionally smooth although they do not have rack-and-pinion. I
think it has a roller-type mechanism which is as good, if not better,
as the rack-and-pinion. Universal back. It means that you have to take
out the ground glass in order to attach the Graflok back. It also
means that, if you can obtain a Graflarger lamp assembly, you can
convert the camera into an enlarger. (I don&rsquo;t know the detail.)
Interchangeable bellows.</p>

<p>Galvin View. There were two models. One has a combination of 9 cm and
5 cm monorails, the other only has a 9 cm rail. Actually, they are the
same. Galvin himself described the 9 cm model a bust. You set up the
camera on the 5cm rail for transport. It is then so small that you
might even hand-hold the camera for landscapes. Maybe the smallest
view camera ever made. Bellows are not intechangeable. No wide-angle
bellows were made, although the one at which I took a look had a
modified bellows. A bag bellows was transplanted in the middle of the
standard bellows after incising a good portion of it. Rail holders of
the front and rear standards have a teflon-like material so that the
teflon can wrap around the rail rod in order to make the slide smooth.
The one at which I took a look seemed to have worn teflon. The two
standards were wobbly. Focusing is by rack and pinion with a knob on
the front standard. Some has a Fresnel focusing back, which was an
upgrade item. I saw an advertizement which included the polaroid back.</p>

<p>General Caveats of 6x9cm view cameras: Not many lenses are
specifically designed for view cameras of this size. For example,
suppose that you want 47mm, 75mm, 125mm, 210mm (which correspond to
your favorite set of 75mm, 135mm, 210mm, ? for 4x5&rdquo;-size view
cameras.) Among the new lenses on the market, only Schneider makes
47mm Super Angulon. Note that most 75mm lenses are of wide-angle
formula design, which are about twice as expensive as the
planar-design lenses if we compare the same speed lenses. There is
Horseman-brand Super ER 75mm f/5.6 of planar-type design (multi-
coated) with a focusing cam specifically designed for Horseman&rsquo;s VHR
and ER. Note that many 4x5&rdquo; users prefer Symmar-type lenses for their
135mm applications. Note also that the focal length of 135mm is the
most used, most popular among 4x5 users in rec.photo land. Rodenstock
makes 75mm f/6.8 6-element wide-angle-formula lenses which are cheaper
and has slightly less image-circle than f/5.6 or f/4.5 wide-angle
lenses of 7 or 8-element designs. Two good points of using a 75mm
wide-angle lens with a roll back or a 6x9cm view camera are that you
do not need a center filter which is about \$200 in addition to the
price of the lens itself, and that you still have a huge image circle
even with the f/6.8 lens. Obviously, you lose on the on-axis
sharpness. Unlike the case of 4x5&rdquo; view cameras with the spring
mechanism, There is no problem with a Graflok back scratching the
ground glass of 6x9cm size. The Graflock back touches the frame area
of the ground glass. You just have to make sure that the spring
opening has enough clearance in case that 6x9cm view camera you are
considering has a spring back. Galvin fits this description. Cambo SC
I has a universal back. So you remove the ground glass and attach the
Graflok back.</p>

<p>Polaroid backs: The usual polaroid backs for 4x5&rdquo; cameras do not fit
on the 6x9cm-camera Graflok back. Horseman&rsquo;s polaroid back needs an
adapter for its polaroid back whose film plane is not at the same
location as the location of non- polaroid films. The whole back
assembly which has rails for the Graflok back has to be removed. This
means if the original manufacturer (in my case, Cambo) does not supply
the adapter, then you are out of luck.</p>

<p>Beware to all potential 2x3 view camera buyers. There is one thing
quite often over looked with this decision - lens sharpness of med.
format vs. large format. I shoot large format 4x5 and 8x10 and have
noticed when I use my 6x9 roll film back on my 4x5 with the best
lenses made, Super symar XL&rsquo;s for example, they still do not compare
in sharpness with shots from my Mamiya 7 camera in 6x7 format. Large
format has better detail due to the size of the format, however, when
you use inferior lenses on smaller formats such as 6x9, you loose a
lot of sharpness. Good medium format lenses are much sharper than all
large format lenses compared on the same format. After seeing these
results with my loupe many times, this is what prevented me from going
to the 2x3 camera. It probably is one of the main reasons that this
format has become very rare relative to 4x5. In addition, it still
seems better in every way to just go 4x5 and then buy a roll film
back, it gives you the option of either format, and if you buy the
right field camera, there is little difference in size. In addition
4x5 field camera will usually offer better movements as well as
accessories. Of course I am not overlooking the one benefit of 2x3
view cameras vs. med. format, movements.. Some med. format cameras now
incorporate some movements, but are very expensive. I hope this adds
some insight to anyone thinking of going 2x3&hellip;? Good luck..</p>

<p>I would like to counter Bill&rsquo;s warning with another viewpoint. I don&rsquo;t
doubt Bill&rsquo;s observation that his Mamiya 7 images show better
sharpness than his SymmarXL. But it is not because MF lenses are
inherently sharper than LF lenses AT THE APERTURES USED IN LANDSCAPE
photography. MF lenses are designed to reach diffration limits at
fairly wide apertures, like f/5.6 to f/8 since they are often used at
these apertures (few weddings are shot at f/22). The tradeoff is
coverage and edge performance. LF lenses are designed to reach
diffration limits at apertures generally from f/16 to f/22, some of
the newer Apo wide angle and &ldquo;digital&rdquo; lenses from Rodenstock and
Schneider reach diffraction limits at f/11. Thus, if you are shooting
at f/22 all of these lenses will have the same resolving power in the
&ldquo;center&rdquo; which, for the LF lenses, will cover your entire frame of
roll-film. The Mamiya is exceptional because it is a rangefinder
design. Thus, like LF lenses, its wide angle and normal lenses don&rsquo;t
have to be retro-focus designs to clear a swinging mirror. Comparing
wide-angle LF lenses to wide-angle MF lenses for reflex cameras at the
same aperture shows no advantage, and in some cases a noticible
disadvantage to the MF lenses at apertures smaller than f/11. There is
a reason Hasselblad makes the SWC! The problem with using roll-film on
a view camera is that diffraction also limits resolution as you stop
down. Thus, while f/22 is great on 4x5, you want to avoid it if
possible when using shorter lenses and smaller formats. For roll-film,
anything smaller than f/16 will cause your LF lenses to produce less
than their optimal performance. Luckily, assuming you use lenses about
<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> as long on roll-film (ie a 75mm instead of a 110mm in 4x5) you
gain about one f-stop of depth of field (assuming constant ration
between radius of circle-of-confusion and film diagonal). So you can
and should use f/16 or wider. This takes practice if you are used to
using f/22 to f/32 in larger formats. The Mamiya, at f/8 or f/11 will
be sharper because of less diffraction effect, and the fact that its
lenses are already diffraction limited (at least in the center) by
those apertures. Another factor is film flattness. The Mamiya has an
excellent film path. Many roll-film backs have real flatness problems.
It really pays to use good (Toyo, Horseman or Sinar if your loaded)
roll-film backs. With the standard Horseman back, you should waste the
next frame if the film has been sitting in the back very long since
the last exposure as it tends to acquire a curl on the rollers. You
also need to carefully and OPTICALLY calibrate the alignment between
your groundglass (gg) and the film plane. You do this optically using
the technique described by Robert Zeichner in View Camera a few years
back. This is the only way to properly take fresnel screens into
account. Accuracy of focus is more critical in the smaller film size,
and again the Mamiya has an advantage here with its rangefinder.
Finally, you need to buy the best LF lenses made. No warm fuzzy
blasts-from-the-past allowed. The newest apo designs pay off in
roll-film work. And, by the way, it is also not a general truth that
larger coverage equals poorer central performance. In lens design,
central performance is usually not a trade-off for corner performance,
but rather a pre-requisite for corner performance. MTF curves for the
f/4.5 series wide-angles from Schneider and Rodenstock all achieve
diffraction limits in the field center by f/16, and in some cases by
f/11. In summary, don&rsquo;t be scared of roll-film with LF cameras and
lenses. Scanned on a Tango and printed on a LightJet5000, color
roll-film images are virtually indistinguishable from 4x5 images at
print sizes less than 20x24. For B&amp;W zone work, stick to sheets! If
you do use roll-film on a view camera, follow these steps: 1. Buy the
best, latest-design, apo lenses you can get. 2. Get high quality
roll-film backs. 3. Optically calibrate your groundglass to your
roll-film backs (if they aren&rsquo;t the same, get new ones!) 4. Change
your shooting technique if you are coming from 4x5. Avoid apertures
smaller than f/16 if you can and remember you get about one extra stop
of depth-of-field. 5. Enjoy more portability, not loading sheetfilm
holders, not paying for QuickLoad, not cleaning sheetfilm holders, not
trying to find good used Grafmatic backs, not cleaning Grafmatic
backs, Velvia Provia IIIF, faster shutter speeds with Velvia on windy
days, less camera cross-section on windy days, f4.5 wide angles that
don&rsquo;t break your back, the 55mm Apo-Grandagon lens, and bracketing
like crazy on that once in a lifetime sunset.</p>
