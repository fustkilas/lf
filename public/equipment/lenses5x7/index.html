<p>Modern lenses for 5x7 cameras</p>

<h2 id="modern-lenses-for-5x7-cameras">Modern Lenses for 5x7 cameras</h2>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/">Q.-Tuan Luong</a> for <a href=".">the Large
Format Page</a></strong></p>

<p>Here I survey the modern lenses that I know to be suitable for the 5x7
format. Depending on the use of the camera, and the intended result,
there are many choices possible which are not mentionned here. In
particular I don&rsquo;t discuss older lenses, or current but little-known
lenses.</p>

<h3 id="wide-angle-lenses">Wide-angle lenses</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>72:</strong> The new Schneider Super Angulon XL. It will just cover 5x7
with no movements. Equivalent to a 14mm in 35mm, it is one of the
widest lenses (with the 47XL on 4x5) which can be used on any LF
camera.</li>
<li><strong>90:</strong> Older lenses such as the Angulon. won&rsquo;t cover the format.
Among modern lenses each manufacturer offers a fast (4.5 or 5.6) and
a slow (6.7 or 8) lenses. The first ones are easier to focus and
offer generally more coverage, but they are bulkier, take larger
filters, and cost two times more. Among them the new Schneider Super
Angulon XL offers significantly more coverage. Among the f8 lenses,
the Nikkor SW offers significantly more coverage (identical to all
the fast lenses but the Super Angulon XL). The other f8 lenses just
cover the format with almost no movements. Therefore the two lenses
mentionned are recommended. If you don&rsquo;t need extensive coverage,
you&rsquo;ll be better of with the Nikkor. Equivalent: 18mm.</li>
<li><strong>120:</strong> Older lenses (ie Angulons) just cover the format. Among the
modern offerings, the Nikkor SW has the most coverage, being
actually sufficient for 8x10, but the others are also very adequate.
Schneider is releasing a new Super-Symmar <sup>110</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.6 XL aspheric which
is half the size of a Super-Angulon (the oldest design), sharper,
and actually covers 8x10. This terrific lens costs \$2300 at B&amp;H in
NYC, but it can be found in Europe (and through some
grey-marketters) for less than \$1300. Equivalent: 24mm.</li>
<li><strong>135:</strong> I know no modern lens of this focal with enough coverage.</li>
<li><strong>150:</strong> The modern plasmats (Symmars, Nikkor W, Sironars&hellip;) will
cover the format with little to no movements. I have a 150
Apo-Sironar-S which covers with so little movements that most of the
time I don&rsquo;t bother using it. The discontinued Apo-Sironar-W has
larger coverage, in a relatively compact package. The Super-Symmar
has lost a lot of his appeal since the Super-Symmar XL was
introduced. The traditional design wide-angles (Super-Angulons,
Nikkor SW, Grandagons&hellip;) will be plenty for 8x10 or more but they
are extremely big and expensive, and therefore not recommended for
5x7. Equivalent: 35mm</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="normal-lenses">Normal lenses</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>210</strong>: Plenty of good choices among the plasmats with adequate
coverage. Since this is a popular focal length for 4x5 it is easy to
find used lenses. The focal is equivalent to a 42mm (like the normal
lens of a Rollei 35) which is slighly shorter than normal, but I
find it better in LF to be too short than too long since you can
crop without losing quality.</li>
<li><strong>240</strong>: Plenty of choices among the plasmats with adequate
coverage. They are bigger (#3 shutter) and significantly more
expensive and rarer than 210, and therefore I would favor more
compact designs such as the G-Claron or the Fuji A which are also
very good. Equivalent to 50mm.</li>
<li><strong>300</strong>: The plasmats are too big and expensive and would be
recommended only for ultra-large formats (larger than 8x10). The
best choices are narrow field lenses such as Nikkor M, G-Clarons,
Apo-Ronars, which are all quite small. The Nikkor M (covers just
8x10) has been recommended by many, however the G-Claron has more
coverage and could be a better choice if you intend to shoot 8x10 as
well. The Apo-ronar has the smallest coverage of all (does not cover
8x10) Equivalent to 60mm.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="long-lenses">Long lenses</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>355-400</strong>: Schneider Tele-Xenar, Fuji-T. Both are telephotos which
will cover little more than the format and are somewhat big. Not
particularly recommended, unless your 5x7 camera doesn&rsquo;t have enough
bellows for this focal (most do). G-Claron, Apo Ronar: narrow field
lenses, but in #3 shutter which makes them much bigger than the
300mm lenses. They will cover 8x10. Equivalent: 70-80mm.</li>
<li><strong>450-480</strong>: Narrow field lenses. The apo ronar is the heaviest. The
highly regarded Nikkor M is reasonable but has also a #3 shutter.
The Fuji C is in a #1 shutter, which makes it as small and light as
a 300, and is also very well regarded. Cover 11x14. Equivalent 90mm.</li>
<li><strong>600</strong>: Fuji has the only non-telephoto lens in this focal, as well
as the only telephoto to fit in a #1 shutter. Equivalent 120mm.</li>
<li><strong>up</strong>: The first series of Nikon telephotos 360-500-720 barely
covers the format according to Nikon. The second series of Nikon
telephotos 600-800(-1200) is huge and weights a ton. Apart from
these, and a couple of exotic lenses with astronomical prices (Apo
Tele Xenars), the only lenses are older designs.</li>
</ul>

4x5</a>, since at this focals they will (almost) all
cover 5x7.</p>
