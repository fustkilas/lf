<h2 id="about-the-large-format-photography-info-site">About the Large Format Photography Info site</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-this-site-about">What is this site about ?</h3>

<p><a href=".">largeformatphotography.info</a> is a primary resource and community of
large format photographers on the internet (including photographers
working with MF view cameras) . It might be a small section of
photography, but the dedication, knowledge, and skill of its
practitioners is usually very high, and you&rsquo;ll find here one of the most
remarkable open photographic communities anywhere, populated by many
experts, but welcoming to beginners as well. The site consists of
several hundred article pages with comments, and a discussion forum with
several tens of thousands messages.</p>

<p>Our mission is to provide a place where large format enthusiasts can
come and exchange freely ideas and help. It is independent, non-profit,
entirely free of advertising and commercial activity, and while we
consider that its contents belongs as a whole to the LF community,
technically each contributor retains the exclusive copyrights to his
postings and the option to have them removed on request, as we do not
clain any rights on them. No financial contribution is required, or even
invited, because we consider that the most valuable contribution is the
time spent by members to contribute contents and maintain the site.</p>

<p>largeformatphotography.info is operated on a volunteer basis by <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/">QT
Luong</a> and <a href="http://tomwestbrook.com">Tom
Westbrook</a>, using server space generously
donated by <a href="http://reid.org/brian/">Brian Reid</a>, refered to us by Tim
Atherton. The forum is moderated by Ralph Barker, Kirk Gittings, Ken
Lee, Neil Poulsen, and Tom Westbrook.</p>

<p>Q.-Tuan Luong started large format photography in 1993. There were a lot
of things which were mysterious back then. After shooting thousands of
sheets of film, some of them are still mysterious, but in the while, he
has beneficiated from advice of really knowledgeable persons on the net.
This site started in 1995 as an attempt to give back to the community by
detailing a few things he had learned, and displaying in an organized
form the information that he had gathered from the net.</p>

<p>Among the people from whom he has learned the most in the early years,
and whose Usenet postings have been reused to begin this site are
Jean-David Beyer, <a href="http://www.butzi.net/">Paul Butzi</a>, Richard Knoppow,
Barry Sherman, John Sparks, <a href="http://www.thalmann.com/">Kerry Thalmann</a>.</p>

<p>As the site evolved, many people contributed directly articles written
specifically for the site. These include:</p>

<p>(sorry, I might have missed a few). And everyone who contributes a point
of view by leaving a comment on a web page deserves thanks.</p>

<p>A few photographers have also authorized this site to reproduce some of
their previously published writings. Those include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paul Hansma</li>
<li>Howard Bond</li>
<li>Stephen Petterson</li>
<li>Robert White</li>
<li>John Sexton</li>
</ul>

<p>After he started putting up this site, readers began to email him
questions, many of them beyond what he knew.</p>

<p>The forum started in 1997, using server, bandwidth, and forum software
(Lusenet) provided generously for free by Philip Greenspun to the
internet community. This software, more carefully though of, in its
simplcity, than many more recent ones, is one of the main factors who
made this forum a success. It has grown to become an outstanding
resource thanks to readers, including more than 60000 postings by
mid-2002. Besides providing the essential community tools used by the
first incarnation of this site, Philip Greenspun has also been a
constant source of inspiration through his own site, especially in its
former non-commercial incarnation.</p>

<p>In June 2002, service on Philip Greenspun&rsquo;s Lusenet system was abruptly
discontinued for the LF Forum. The QA Forum software on
largeformatphotography.info replicates the Lusenet system, a testimony
to its design excellence. It is the product of the work of several
volunteers. The idea of rewriting Lusenet using the more widely
available PHP/Mysql platform was due to <a href="http://joshwand.com/">Josh
Wand</a> who developed a first prototype. The effort
was subsequently taken over by <a href="http://binoni.nu/">Bjorn Nilsson</a>. After
Bjorn suffered a severe accident, the work was finished by <a href="http://tomwestbrook.com">Tom
Westbrook</a>, who also transfered the original
postings from Lusenet based on data graciouly provided to us by Philip
Greenspun. All volunteered their time and talent to make this happen.
Some history is available in <a href="polls/">old polls</a>, and <a href="lfphotoinfo.html">Why not at
photo.net ?</a>. []{#terms}</p>
