height=&amp;ldquo;120&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those close-ups were extracted from the image below. Each of them contains enough detail to make a sharp photograph on its own. Click on them to view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;autumn-reflections.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;autumn-reflections.small.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;300&amp;rdquo;
height=&amp;ldquo;214&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]{#lf}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For landscapes, I prefer &lt;a href=&#34;../canham/canham.html&#34;&gt;this large format (LF)
camera&lt;/a&gt;, because it produces an image which
matches my perception of a visually rich world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because the size of the film is 5x7 inches (12.7cm x 17.8cm), the
camera records an amazing amount of detail, 25 times what is contained
in a regular 135 (24mm x 36mm) frame. Everything which I saw is on the
film, and even more. When I examine my transparencies under a lupe, I
notice from time to time details which escaped me when I was looking at
the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that what I display here does not even capture the full detail in
the original transparency, but only a quarter of it: the scanning was
done only at a resolution necessary to produce a 24x30 inches (60 x 75
cm) print, which is 6000 x 9000 pixels. However, the transparency has a
resolution of at least 50 lpm, is 5x7 inches (12.7cm x 17.8cm) and
therefore could have been used to produce a quality digital image file
at least four times larger (12000 x 17000 pixels). Such a file would
have been close to 1 Gigabye. At the resolution used, there is
absolutely no fuzziness and no grain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the LF camera is not rigid because the lens is connected to the
film plane with a bellows. This let me control the perspective and the
distribution of sharpness in a way which cannot be achieved with a
regular camera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember the trees as beeing parallel to each other. The LF camera
renders them that way. However the camera is looking down since the
lake fills up more than two-thirds of the frame. With a regular
camera, this would cause the trees in the background to lean towards
the edge of the frame, which would not be quite right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember each part of the scene with the same clarity. The LF
camera looks at the close objects sharply and looks at the horizon
sharply at the same time: notice that the grass in the foreground,
only a few feet in front of the camera, is seen as clearly as the
distant trees. In contrast, a regular camera has to focus either
close or far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this particular photograph, those adjustments were quite simple and
intuitive. It was getting dark fast. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make the
photograph in full daylight, because I knew that the colors would be
lost to the contrast, and instead I chose to wait for the quiet and soft
light of dusk. After leveling the camera, I lowered the lens using front
fall to obtain the composition I wanted. I then tilted the lens, which
tilts the plane of sharp focus, until it became horizontal. I was lucky
that day because the air was quite still, so even in the 15 second
exposure (necessitated by the f 22 aperture and the slow speed of Fuji
Velvia), there was only minimal blurring of the grasses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Large Format Primer</title>
      <link>http://lflf.surge.sh/start/why/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: This article explains what large format photography is about,
and weights the advantages and disadvantages of using a large format
camera. It also provides references for further information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-large-format-camera&#34;&gt;What is a Large format camera?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s grand-dad&amp;rsquo;s bellows box-like camera, where you had to disappear
under a dark cloth. The principle remains the same, however nowadays
they have evolved into precise and sophisticated instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a few notable exceptions, these cameras share the following
characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large image size&lt;/strong&gt;: 4x5 inches (10x12cm), the most popular format
by far, up to 20x24 inches (the Polaroid camera, which can be rented
on-site for a reasonable fee). The film comes in separate sheets
rather than rolls, but see below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible bellows connecting the front and back&lt;/strong&gt;: they allow the
use of a range of focal lengths (with different lenses. there are no
zooms in such formats) and focussing distances, as well as providing
for lateral adjustments and angular adjustments between film plane
and lens plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground glass viewing&lt;/strong&gt;: makes it possible to assess the image with
great accuracy once you get used to the dimness and inversion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interchangeable lenses&lt;/strong&gt;: you are not limited to a particular
mount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Medium format cameras use roll-film which is 6cm wide so
that the format available on those cameras are (all in cm) 4.5x6, 6x6,
6x7,6x9,6x12,6x17. Therefore they produce image whose size is less than
that produced by large format cameras (hence the name). The vast
majority of medium format cameras operate a bit like 35mm cameras
(&amp;ldquo;small format&amp;rdquo;) and in particular don&amp;rsquo;t have features 2,3,4. However, a
few medium format cameras share these features, and are also considered
on this web site, since they actually operate like large format cameras.
On the other hand, with almost all the large format cameras it is
possible to use roll-film holders of various sizes and to therefore
produce medium-format images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-benefits-of-the-large-format-camera&#34;&gt;What are the main benefits of the large format camera?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larger image size.&lt;/strong&gt; Results are sharper, have a better tonality,
and are grain-free. A 4x5 has 13 times the area of a 35mm frame. A
5x7 has 25 times that area. Contact printing gives an image whose
delicacy cannot be matched by any enlargment, and allow a number of
&amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera movements.&lt;/strong&gt; You have more control on the final geometry of
the photographed objects and of the perspective as well as on the
areas of sharpness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual sheets of film.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use as many types of film as
you like easily, easily, including Polaroid, and process each sheet
of film individually for optimum results. The latter point makes it
possible to use Ansel Adams Zone System for black and white film.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contemplative approach.&lt;/strong&gt; You take your time for each image This
is the flip-side of the drawbacks: you spend so much time on a
single exposure, and invest so much effort in it that you&amp;rsquo;re
compelled to think it through carefully and do it right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-drawbacks-of-the-large-format-camera&#34;&gt;What are the main drawbacks of the large format camera?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything is manual&lt;/strong&gt;. Most other cameras do some things
automatically for us that we take for granted &amp;ndash; like preventing
fogged film, double-exposures, non-exposures and so on. You need to
remember to do things that were never an issue even with the most
manual 35mm camera. As a result, &lt;a href=&#34;mistakes.html&#34;&gt;there are more ways to make
mistakes than you could ever imagine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment and film:&lt;/strong&gt; the equipment is bulky, heavy (a good tripod
is necessary) and relatively expensive. The cost per photograph is
considerably higher than the same image in smaller format. Think of
it as being proportional to the film area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larger magnification: longer focals are needed for the same angle
of view:&lt;/strong&gt; The equivalent of a 24mm in 35mm is a &lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; lens in 4x5,
a 120mm lens in 5x7. Depth of field is a serious problem. The
cameras movements become *necessary* to put everything in focus,
and even though some subjects cannot be focussed entirely. Start
thinking f32 where you thought f5.6 ! As a result you often get very
long exposures, so wind shake (esp. with vegetation) and reciprocity
failure begin to take their toll. Work which requires naturally a
high degree of magnification, ie macro and tele-photo, is
particularly impractical, the former because of the depth of field
limitations, the second because lenses would have to be insanely
long.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything takes a long time&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loading/unloading your holders at home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving around your heavy backpack or case and tripod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting your camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;composing, esp. in low light with slow / wide-angle lenses (f8
max aperture is common)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focussing: tricks are necessary to overcome the depth of field
problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exposing: long exposures are quite common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impractical to photograph quick action or candids, and even in
landscape you&amp;rsquo;ll end up missing optimal conditions. Your
productivity in terms of number of images (but not necessarily in
terms of number of great images) will be very reduced. Think a dozen
shots or less when you thought a few rolls. Even though your
friends/spouse will complain about the waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover by yourself many quirks of Large format
photography, like the fact that the dark cloth sometimes tend to fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;A_little_too_windy_for_8x10.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;A_little_too_windy_for_8x10.small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;200&amp;rdquo;
height=&amp;ldquo;138&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a photograph of my friend Charles attempting to use a
darkcloth for focus and composition on a 8x10 . 40 mph winds were just
a little to strong for the darkcloth. He ended up using the viewfinder
and foot scale with this 300 mm setup. &lt;strong&gt;Mark Cieslikowski&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;pollack.html&#34;&gt;A vivid account by Michael Pollack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]{#size}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-real-gain-compared-to-other-formats&#34;&gt;What is the real gain compared to other formats?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consensus seems to be that as far as enlargements are concerned, the
difference between 4x5 and 35mm is huge, but that the &lt;a href=&#34;quality.html&#34;&gt;difference
between 4x5 and 6x7&lt;/a&gt; will show up only in big
enlargements, 16x20 or larger. At 16x20 modern LF lenses have a slight
edge due to reduced granularity and high contrast, above that, modern
4x5 wins due to granularity. However, you will see a bigger difference
with format for B&amp;amp;W prints than with color prints. On the other hand, a
&lt;a href=&#34;contact-print.html&#34;&gt;contact print&lt;/a&gt; has a special quality that some feel
cannot be obtained by an enlargement. Contact printing is also the only
way to work with some alternative process such as paladium/platinium,
carbon, etc&amp;hellip; []{#price}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;will-i-have-to-sell-the-house&#34;&gt;Will I have to sell the house?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large format photography is actually not that expensive, especially
&lt;a href=&#34;price-med.html&#34;&gt;compared to medium format photography&lt;/a&gt; (the prices for
the 35mm market are influenced by the fact that it is quite
consumer-oriented), and a good large format system can be built for no
more than a good modern medium format system. There is also possibility
to do large format on a budget. A fairly good 4x5 can be bought used for
less than \$500, and if you are willing to accept some limitations, you
can get something which works for a couple hundred of dollars. The
latest lenses are indeed very expensive, on the other hand there are a
number of older lenses which are really inexpensive, a couple of hundred
dollars or less. Most of the lenses will be totally appropriate for B&amp;amp;W
work. They don&amp;rsquo;t have to be as sharp as lenses for smaller formats.
Modern lenses, which will produce results virtually indistinguishable
from the the latest designs, can be bought used for a rather reasonnable
price. Since LF systems are usually not submitted to an heavy use like
smaller formats, gear which is decades old will usually work fine. A
great news is that as you have built a good set of lenses, when you
upgrade to a better camera, you just keep them, and maybe change the
lensboards. At one point I was hesitating between the Pentax 67 (one of
the cheapest MF systems) and 4x5. One of the reasons which got me
decided for the 4x5 was that the price of the 4x5 system was a little
lower. Film looks expensive too, but you won&amp;rsquo;t shoot as many images as
you used to. If you do color, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to have your film
processed by a lab. The total cost of a 4x5 Velvia (film+processing) is
less than \$4, the cost of a 5x7 less than \$8. On the other hand, B&amp;amp;W
film home processed is quite cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-more-information&#34;&gt;How to find more information?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;books/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: for instruction as well as inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one journal devoted exclusively to large format: []{}&lt;a href=&#34;http://greenspun.com/ct/qtluong/photography/lf/why.html?send_to=http://www.viewcamera.com&#34;&gt;View
Camera
TM&lt;/a&gt;,
published by Steve Simmons (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Largformat@aol.com&#34;&gt;Largformat@aol.com&lt;/a&gt;). The quality has been
overall high compared to the mainstream magazines. Over the past few
years, the magazine has concentrated on interviews and portfolios, in
which the emphasis is on vision and photographs, rather than technique.
Earlier in its history, the journal had more technical articles, but
because it tries not to rehash topics which had been already published,
the information really useful for LF beginners is limited in current
issues. You could order back issues, but if you&amp;rsquo;re after technical basic
material, you&amp;rsquo;d certainly be better served by
&lt;a href=&#34;books/general.html&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not exclusively devoted to LF, &lt;a href=&#34;http://greenspun.com/ct/qtluong/photography/lf/why.html?send_to=http://www.phototechmag.com/&#34;&gt;Photo
Techniques&lt;/a&gt;
(USA) regulary runs more detailed reviews of LF equipment written by
actual users, as well as excellent how-to articles on LF techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Discussion forums:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&#34;http://lflf.surge.sh/lfforum&#34;&gt;LF Q&amp;amp;A forum&lt;/a&gt; associated on
this site has proven to be the best place on the internet for discussion
of LF related issues. It is very focussed, yet has the most active
participation of any LF bulletin boards on the web. Other LF discussion
forums on the web include:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://greenspun.com/ct/qtluong/photography/lf/why.html?send_to=http://www.f32.net&#34;&gt;f32.net&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usenet:&lt;/strong&gt; The newsgroup:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://greenspun.com/ct/qtluong/photography/lf/why.html?send_to=news:rec.photo.equipment.large-format&#34;&gt;rec.photo.equipment.large-format&lt;/a&gt;
dedicated exclusively to LF photography is one of the best places on the
internet to discuss. This newsgroup is one of the most civil on Usenet,
but still, it is unmoderated, so flame wars occur from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mailing lists&lt;/strong&gt; There used to be a mailing list, the &amp;ldquo;Large Format
Digest&amp;rdquo;, discontinued since the creation of the previously mentioned
newsgroup. Besides reading it from the web, you can subscribe to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lflf.surge.sh/lfforum&#34;&gt;LF
Q&amp;amp;A forum&lt;/a&gt; to read it by email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. I started large format photography in 1993. There were a lot of
things which were mysterious back then. After shooting thousands sheets
of film, some of them are still mysterious, but I have beneficiated from
advice of really knowlegeable persons on the net. I wrote this series in
order to try and give back by answering the questions that I was myself
asking a couple of years ago. It is written with location and field
photography in mind. I have only very little knowledge about studio
work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
