<h2 id="the-camera">The camera</h2>

<p>Think first about your intended application. 35mm cameras are universal,
MF cameras and LF cameras are really more specialized. What kind of work
are you going to do, and in which conditions ?</p>

<h4 id="which-format-to-use"><em>Which format to use ?</em></h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>roll-film</strong> Shooting roll-film with a view camera is an
interesting combination. There are cameras and backs which let you
shoot 6x7, 6x9, 6x12, 6x17. Compared to 4x5, you don&rsquo;t have to deal
with sheet film, the cost is very low (lower than for 35mm actually,
if the surface is considered), and there is a very wide choice of
film. If you chose a 2x3 view camera, it can be actually cheaper
than a lot of MF systems, and might not be heavier, especially if
you buy lenses with small coverage. However, compared to
convenentional MF systems, you gain &ldquo;only&rdquo; camera movements (their
effect is not always very easy to judge on the small image area) and
you loose a lot of ease of use (this might be a plus for folks
willing to &ldquo;slow down&rdquo;). Another option that I find more interesting
is to use a <a href="#roll-film">roll-film back</a> with a 4x5 camera. There
are 4x5 lightweight cameras wich are not much more heavy than 2x3
cameras. Then you can have the option of doing 4x5 if the
opportunity looks very good. Speaking from my own experience and
that of other folks, when you come home the 2x3 images will look a
bit small if you have shot 4x5, and you will probably think that
given the burden of carrying and operating a view camera, you&rsquo;d
rather have the big image. If you use a panoramic format like 6x12,
this comparison might not apply.</li>
<li><strong>4x5</strong> This is in practice the smaller format where you can use
sheet film (2x3 sheet film exists but is marginal). It is by far the
most popular format, with lots of cameras, lenses (from 45mm to as
long as the bellows will accomodate), film, different type of
holders (including roll-film, polaroid, preloaded). For most people
that&rsquo;s the format of choice.</li>
<li><strong>5x7</strong> The equipment is not really heavier than for 4x5: the lenses
are most of the time the same, there are 6lbs cameras. It is mostly
the holders which are bigger: they produce an image which is almost
two times as large, but is more rectangular, in a format homothetic
to 35mm and 6x9. It is large enough to produce decent contacts. but
still small enough that it is relatively easy to enlarge. The only
significant drawback comes from the scarcity of the film (as of
summer 96, the only slide film available in the USA are Kodak EPP
and EPR. Euro or Japaneese photographers have Fuji emulsions). One
thing that I am really missing is the possibility to use Polaroid
film, and quickloads. Processing and printing is more difficult to
obtain with labs, and if you want a new color enlarger, you might
have to buy a 8x10 enlarger. However, all these problems do not
affect b&amp;w photographers.</li>
<li><strong>8x10 and larger</strong> These formats gives you beautiful contact
prints. Contact printing is required for some alternative process
(like Platinium). The marginal quality over 4x5 or 5x7 obtained in
enlargements is probably noticeable only for the extreme
enlargements. The drawback is the size and weight of the equipment,
as well as its cost. Older 8x10 cameras can be have for (relatively)
cheap, and a Philips camera is not much heavier than some 4x5
cameras. However larger formats (sometimes called Ultra LF) require
a considerable amount of work.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-features-to-look-for-in-a-camera"><em>What features to look for in a camera ?</em></h4>

<p>Here are a few things to consider. There are more discussions about the
various trade-offs (wood vs metal, monorail vs flatbed, etc&hellip;)
elsewhere on the <a href="./">LF page</a>. Remember that YOU have to find out what
your priorities are first, and that not every camera, no matter how
highly praised, is for everyone.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Portable enough.</strong> Whereas all the folding cameras are portable
and have a reasonnable weight (3lbs - 7 lbs), some monorails are too
heavy and bulky to be used in the field. There is a tradeoff here
between portability and and versatility (possibility to use many
focals and movements), and also rigidity. Usually, for the same
features, a wooden camera will be lighter, but often less compact
than an equivalent metal field camera.</li>

<li><p><strong>Allow you to use your focals of choice</strong> All the cameras do what
they are designed for with a normal lens. However, with shorter and
longer lenses difficulties might arise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short focals</strong>. Some flatbed cameras have very limited
wide-angle abilities, due to:</p>

<ul>
<li>large minimum extension,</li>
<li>fixed bellows (the bellows compression will make movements
impossible unless you have a wide-angle bellows which is
shorter and more flexible)</li>
<li>beds showing in the field of view</li>
</ul>

<p>A recessed lensboard can make up for some problems by allowing a
larger lens to film distance than the focal length of your lens.
However, they are expensive (\$150) and the controls of the lens
become hard to reach. A monorail is usually more flexible, since
all of them have a small minimum extension, wide-angle bellows.
Depending on the nature of the tripod mount attachment, the rail
showing in the field of view might or might not be a problem,
but there are sometimes optional short rails.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Long focals</strong>. A camera with bellows which are too short will
not allow you to use long lenses, or to do close-ups. The cure
for this problem are very limited. You can use on some cameras a
combinations of front tilts, or get an extension board (opposite
of a recessed board), but this will give you only a few
additional centimeters. Here, again monorails are more flexible,
since you can usually purchase a longer rail and extension
bellows.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Enough movements for your type of photography.</strong> The monorails
have all the movements, whereas some type of flat bed cameras have
almost none. Studio photography usually requires a great deal of
image control, architecture requires shifts to maintain correct
perspective. Landscape require the less movements, although to
obtain adequate depth of field due to the fact that longer focals
are needed for a given field of view, some tilts are often
necessary.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Rigidity and precision of alignment</strong> This is all about sharpness.
To shoot in windy conditions you need a camera which is rigid enough
so that the standards won&rsquo;t move (resulting in unsharp pictures).
The locks have to be strong enough so that the standards don&rsquo;t move
when you insert the holder. Misalignements between standards or
within the back standard to the film plane might cause misfocus in
some areas of the image (although this is critical for reproduction
work, I doubt that for real shooting it matters). Generally
speaking, the metal cameras are more rigid and precisely aligned
than the wooden cameras. The lighweight cameras are more likely to
have problems here.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ease of operation.</strong> Geared controls, positive and well placed
locks, spirit levels, various scales, zero detents, smooth
operation, rear focussing (very important for macro work), etc..,
all help. If complicated adjustments are used, a
<a href="yaw.html">yaw-free</a> design might help. This feature is not relevant
otherwise.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="which-is-best-wood-or-metal"><em>Which is best, wood, or metal ?</em></h4>

<p>The main advantage of wood (besides being cheaper to work) is that it is
lighter. A consequence is that for the same weight you can make a bigger
camera, which in turn will provide you more movements and more
extension. A typical example are the Wisner and Canhams which are quite
bulky (for 4x5 cameras) but offer more movements and bellows than any
other field cameras. A metal camera using the same design would weight
more than 11 lbs. Wood is also much better at dampening high-frequency
vibration than any metal or metal alloy.</p>

<p>Metal has technically many advantages. It is more rigid, which result in
less flexing and low frequency vibrations. This is good for long
extensions. It is more solid, resulting in a more durable camera. If
your tripod is knocked over by the wind, a metal camera is quite likely
to remain functional with a few scratches, whereas a wooden camera could
be totally destroyed. My reversible wooden back broke at the edge, which
would have been unlikely to happy with metal. The stability with respect
to environmental conditions like humidity and temperature is also better
(one day my Canham would focus quite smoothly, one day it would be quite
sticky). Last, it is easier to implement small features on metal.
Therefore metal cameras tend generally to be more compact, and to offer
greater accessory systems like reflex hoods, etc&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="which-cameras-to-consider-to-get-started-on-a-budget"><em>Which cameras to consider to get started on a budget?</em></h4>

<p>It is best to buy used equipment. Shutterbug (dealers advertisements,
classified, swap announces) and the net are good sources. Some
recommended used stores with knowledgeable and honest people are Midwest
Photo Exchange and Lens and Repro. There is not much which can go wrong
on a large format camera which has not been seriously abused, since
there are no delicate small high precision parts or electronics. Older
cameras are well usable, but usually lack the convenience of more modern
designs. Some of them are so beat-up that they lost their original
rigidity. Another thing to watch for is pinholes in the bellows. A new
bellows can always be installed, but the price might be a significant
fraction of that of the cheaper cameras. Here are some suggestions
(refer to the reviews for more details):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cheapest.</strong> A Speed or Crown Graphic press camera (at the expense
of movements, not a good choice if you are interested in perspective
control or depth of field control. A basic monorail like Calumet
CC-400, Omega, Graphic View II (at the expense of portability, at
about 8 lbs., they are a little heavy and bulky for hiking), Bender
(if you like woodworking). A Burke and James (good movements, more
portable than a monorail, might be a bit ratty). \$250.</li>
<li><strong>Cheap.</strong> A new Calumet Cadet (a monorail camera). \$400. Toyo
45cx. \$450. A used lightweight wood-field (such as the Tachihara).
\$400-\$500. A Technika III (metal, flatbed, adequate movements).
\$600.</li>
<li><strong>Still reasonable.</strong> A new lightweight wood-field (around \$700), a
used Wista, a used Zone VI. The new Arca-Swiss discovery (maybe too
recent to find used) and the Sinar A1 (monorail cameras).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-lenses">The lenses</h2>

<h4 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-lens"><em>What to look for in a lens ?</em></h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focal.</strong> You are probably familiar with 35mm. Pick up your
favorite focals and find the equivalent LF focals either using <a href="http://www.mat.uc.pt/~rps/photos/angles.html">Rui
Salgueiro&rsquo;s field-of-view
calculator</a> or <a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/philg/photo/lens-table.html">Ed
Scott&rsquo; comparison
tables</a>.
Note however that while 5x7 is homothetic to 35mm, 4x5 and 8x10 are
both more squarish. More folks are happy with just one lens in the
LF world than in 35mm. Personnally, I would tend to err on the wide
side, since cropping is not too much of an issue.</li>
<li><strong>Coverage.</strong> A lens projects an image circle which must be large
enough to cover the film area without vignetting. The absolute
minimun which is required is the diagonal of the format. If some
movements are used, the diameter of the image circle has to be
larger to cover the film area. The larger this circle is, the more
movements you can do. In particular, it is easy to calculate how
must shift you can get knowing the image circle and the format. The
image circle is usually expressed in a millimeter diameter, at
infinity, and at a specific aperture of f/16 or f/22. Stopping down
might increase its diameter. Focussing to closer distances always
does.
For general use, make sure to get enough to be able to do some
movements, maybe around 180mm for 4x5 and around 230mm for 5x7.
Applications like table top and architecture photography often
require extensive movements and therefore larger image circles.
Lenses with more coverage than you need will be heavy, big, and
expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum aperture.</strong> You won&rsquo;t use a LF lens wide open, however a
large maximum aperture ( f/4.5 or f/5.6) makes viewing and focussing
easier, especially if you are indoors or like to photograph in low
light. However, for a given focal length, the faster lens will be
larger, heavier and more expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Portability.</strong> Be careful here. Lenses of same focal lengths vary
*considerably* in size and weight ! Make sure to see the lens
before buying. Generally speaking focal length, coverage, and speed
contribute to a big lens, all other factors being equal. That&rsquo;s
where modern lenses don&rsquo;t necessarily shine. A significant portion
of the weight and bulk can be due to the shutter. Longer focal
lengths and/or faster lenses often come with a big #3.</li>
<li><strong>Optical quality.</strong> Basically all the modern lenses (current models
from Fuji,Nikon, Rodenstock, Schneider) are good enough, and very
difficult to distinguish from each other at the apertures used in
practice. For color work, it is generally recommended to stick to
those, or to relatively recent multicoated lenses, although a single
coated lens properly shaded might work fine. This is less critical
for B&amp;W. For details, see <a href="lenses-general.html">a general
discussion</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Fit.</strong> Some big lenses cannot be used with some field cameras or
with some lensboards. Also, make sure you have enough belows. When
using long focal lengths you may consider choosing a telephoto
design lens (usually designated with a &ldquo;T&rdquo;) rather than a regular
design lens of the same focal length. These lenses require
approximatively <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the bellows a regular lens would. However,
they are usually more expensive, have less coverage, and behave a
bit weird with respect to tilts. They are not necessarily more
compact or lighter.</li>
<li><strong>Working shutter.</strong></li>

<h2 id="film-and-holders">Film and holders</h2>

<h4 id="conventional-vs-preloaded-film-quickload-readyload-polaroid"><em>Conventional vs preloaded film (Quickload, Readyload, Polaroid)</em></h4>

<p>You can either use film that you load yourself in cut-film holders or
preloaded film.</p>

<p>In the first case, you need a dark and relatively clean place to load
your film holders (might be a problem when travelling), and to unload
them. Dust might be a problem, you have to clean your holders carefully.
You cannot have too many holders. With a large number of holders, not
only you&rsquo;ll be sure not to run out of film ready to shoot, but you&rsquo;ll
have to reload less often, and you can keep exposed film in holders,
which makes tracking easier.</p>

<p>Readyloads are from Kodak, Quickloads from Fuji. The readyloads from
Kodak hold two sheets of film, the Quickloads hold one. The film is in a
paper packet that you put in a special holder (they are made by Kodak,
Fuji, Polaroid). Polaroid film can be processed instantly or latter,
inside the holder. The other films are processed normally in the lab.
Here are the advantages of preloaded film:</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to load and unload. Especially nice in the field.</li>
<li>Almost dust-free. Because they&rsquo;re factory loaded in a clean room,
the only dust you get on the film is the dust that lands on it after
you pull the envelope/darkslide.</li>
<li>Lighter/Less bulky. Preloaded film allows you to carry more
ready-to-use film (although in the long run, if you are using lots
of film, it will end up being heavier) since you don&rsquo;t have the
weight of individual film holders.</li>
<li>Easier to track after exposure. You can just write information on
each packet.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main disadvantages are</p>

<ul>
<li>more expensive (a sheet of conventional Velvia 4x5 costs \$1.7 vs
\$2.6 for preloaded)</li>
<li>only a limited number of emulsions are offered by Fuji (in
particular no B&amp;W film), Kodak, and Polaroid (the non-instant film
is Fuji film).</li>
<li>The Kodak system is known to suffer from light leaks</li>
<li>Less sharp (maybe). In a Camera and Darkroom article, J.Englender
writes that the preloaded system do not yield as sharp results as
conventional holders due to film flatness problems (the best results
are obtained with Graphmatics, then conventional holders, Fuji and
Kodak holders, and Polaroid holders). Many people ignore that.</li>
<li>if you have a lot of film to carry on a long trip, the enveloppes
end up adding up.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best results for the preloaded films seems to be obtained using the
dedicated holder (Fuji and Kodak), although the Fuji Quickload work OK
with the Polaroid holder. The new 545i holder is significantly lighter
than the old 545 which was all metal.</p>

<h4 id="conventional-cut-film-holders"><em>Conventional cut-film holders</em></h4>

<p>If you decide not to use the preloaded systems but instead buy your film
in sheets and load it, you have the choice between regular film holders
which hold one sheet on each side, and Grafmatics. Generally speaking,
if you buy used holders, check them carefully for dust and light leaks
problems.</p>

<p>Wooden holders tend to slide better in wooden cameras, and are slightly
lighter than plastic holders, but they cannot be found new. As far as
new holders are concerned, most people use Fidelity or Lisco holders,
which are the cheapest. Some brands make more expensive holders, but
nobody has been able to prove that they yield sharper pictures in usual
working conditions. The extremity of the dark slide is marked with two
colors (black and white) and raised dots so that you can remember
whether they contain blank film or exposed film. In addition, there is a
tab which is supposed to keep the dark slide locked and prevent you from
removing it accidentally, as well as help you identified loaded vs empty
holders, but I have found that it tends to be quite unreliable. Riteway
makes a holder with a button instead of the tab, which is an
improvement, but it is not compatible with some cameras.</p>

<p><a href="holders.html#grafmatics">Grafmatics</a> are more light and compact, and
allow you to shoot in a sequence, but the loading is more difficult,
esp. if you want to unload after using a holder only partially. They can
be bought only used. []{#roll-film}</p>

<h4 id="roll-film-backs"><em>Roll-film backs</em></h4>

<p>Roll film backs are available for all roll-film sizes to 6x12 the most
common being 6x7 and 6x9. There are two types of roll-film holders.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Graflock-type holders</strong>: Some 4x5 cameras have a back (Graflock,
this standard was introduced on the Graflex cameras) where you
remove the ground-glass assembly and replace it with a roll-film
back. There are plenty of brands to chose from: Graflex, Singer,
Linhof (super-rollex), Mamiya RB, Horseman, some of which can be
found for quite cheap.</li>
<li><strong>Slide-in type holders</strong>: These holders are flat because the film
spools are at one end. They can be inserted under the ground glass
like a sheet film holder. Almost all the cameras accept them, but be
sure to check for compatibility. The Calumet holders are quite cheap
and are now produced in 6x7, 6x9, 6x12 (the latter is quite
expensive actually). Sinar has a vario holder which allow you to
switch format (from 6x4.5 to 6x12) at any time, for \$2500 new.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personnally I prefer the second type, because I find them faster to use
and it is said that the film flatness is better.</p>

<h4 id="polaroid-film"><em>Polaroid film</em></h4>

<p>Polaroid film is a great learning tool because you get instant feedback.
Some people recommend that when you start 4x5 you expose Polaroids to
begin. Another special application is proofing, to check composition,
exposure (esp. with flash), and focus (by luping the negative). But
Polaroid material has its own photographic merits, and can yield
beautiful prints and negatives. It has been used as a medium by some
masters.</p>

<p>To use Polaroid film, all you need is a 4x5 camera, and a Polaroid
holder. The sheet film holders are model 545 (older, metal construction)
or 545i (current, plastic construction, lighter). They are reasonnably
sized so they can also be used with Quickload (and maybe Readyloads,
although the failure rate is catastrophic). There are two other Polaroid
holders, for pack film, the 550 which accepts 4x5&rdquo; pack film and the 405
which uses 3 1/4x 4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; pack film. Packs film are cheaper, but the film
area is smaller than 4x5, so that makes them useful mostly for checking
exposure. Personally I would just go for the 4x5 image given by the 545
(which is already a bit smaller than 4x5)</p>

<p>Polaroid also makes material for 8x10 cameras, but it is quite pricey
and you also need a special processor, unlike in 4x5 where the holder
serves as the processor.</p>

<p>For more information, call Polaroid to get a free guide to their film. I
have personally found type 52 (gives a beautiful print), type 54 (gives
a print not as beautiful, but which does not require coating), and type
55 (gives a print AND a negative), and type 56 (gives a beautiful sepia
print) useful. Unfortunately with type 55, the negative is about 1.5
stops slower than the print, so you cannot get both well-exposed. The
negative needs also a good cleaning to remain usable. <a href="polaroid55.html">More details on
55</a>. All these materials are B&amp;W. I don&rsquo;t have too much
experience with the color materials, but I heard they are quite
sensitive to heat.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-tripod">The tripod</h2>

<h4 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-tripod"><em>What to look for in a tripod ?</em></h4>

<ul>
<li>portability</li>
<li>stability/rigidity</li>
<li>working height</li>
<li>ease of use</li>
</ul>

<p>The first and second points are contradicting, and therefore you have to
compromise. A reasonnable choice would be something like a Gitzo series
300 or equivalent. A Gitzo series 400 would hold any view camera. A
series 200 would be considered by many to be marginal, but I find it
quite usable (see below). Quite a few people use wooden tripods. While
it is said that they damp vibrations better than metal tripod, I find
that their only real advantage is ruggedness (due actually to a simpler
construction, rather than material), and warmer feel. On the other hand,
with respect to the four previous points, for a given weight, the metal
tripod is always better.</p>

<h4 id="do-i-have-to-get-a-monster-tripod-for-this-large-format-camera"><em>Do I have to get a monster tripod for this large format camera ?</em></h4>

<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need a tripod bigger than the one you use for your
small camera. I used to have a very heavy tripod (Zone VI, 16 lbs, ouch
!) that i used next to the car, and a Gitzo 226 for hiking and
traveling. Since then, i have sold my Zone VI, and use exclusively the
Gitzo 1228 with a Linhof Profi II ball head. The combination weights
4lbs, and is quite usable.</p>

<p>The reasons why I think that a light tripod such that the 1228 is plenty
adequate for my LF use are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The real issue is the rigidity of the legs, NOT the weight of the
tripod. With this respect, the Gitzos are pretty good. For the weight, I
carry plenty enough. I have put a ring at the bottom of the center
column, and attach by camera bag to it. The combo has a heavy weight
that cannot be beat !</p></li>

<li><p>Some medium format or even 35mm settups are in fact heavier than my
LF, but I see NO reason why a heavier camera would require a heavier
tripod (as long as it does not collapse, of course). Since regardless of
the format, blur due to camera shake is mostly a function of focal
length, I would tend to say that very stable tripods are needed mostly
for very long lenses. Thus if the 1228 is sufficient to hold a 300mm
lens for a 35mm camera (and it is), then it is also sufficient to hold a
300m for a 4x5 in still conditions. Most of my LF photography is done
with 120 and 210 mm lenses.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tripod-head-with-qr-system">Tripod head with QR system</h4>

<p>A pan-tilt head is more convenient, because it is more easy to level the
camera, and you can tilt the camera front to back without unwanted
sideway tilt. If your camera does not have levels, it would be useful to
have them on your head. A quick release system is very nice to have.
Unfortunately the smallest PT head made by Manfrotto which meets all
these requirements is the 3047, and although it is nice to use, it
weights almost as much as my Gitzo 1228. I also have a smaller PT head,
the 3029, but it does not have a built-in QR system, and i find it
becomes quite bulky if I attach one.</p>

<p>Mostly because of the weight and bulk savings, many photographers use
ball heads. An other benefit is that they work better for 35mm and MF if
you use a second format. The Linhof Profi II is good enough for most
lightweight LF cameras, however, the heavier and more expensive
Arca-Swiss B1 is more rigid, smoother, and has an elliptic ball to
prevent flip-over.</p>

<p>A Quick Release (QR) system is not absolutely necessary, but very nice
to have, especially if you switch between different formats. You can buy
a Manfrotto/Bogen adaptator to use the Bogen hex plates with several
ball heads by replacing the stock platform. The spring-loaded Bogen QR
system is inexpensive, quick and easy to operate, lock positively and
well thanks to the hexagonal shape. If tightened enough, the plates
won&rsquo;t slip. However, if you are using at the same time smaller cameras,
you might prefer the Arca Swiss system, where you slip the camera plate
into a dovetail. With that system, camera plates can be custom made for
each camera, which ensures a better fit, while the Bogen plates tend to
stick out from small camera bodies. Don&rsquo;t get the generic plates from
Arca-Swiss. That would negate most of the advantages of the system !
Really Right Stuff is generally thought to make better fitting plates
than Kirk Enterprises.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="accessories">Accessories</h2>

<h3 id="darkcloth">Darkcloth</h3>

<p>You can use a jacket, but a dark cloth is preferable and does not cost
much anyway compared to the price of the rest of the equipment. A cloth
with a white exterior is nice on hot days or if photographing on a busy
site. Personnally I don&rsquo;t like those which have weight (ie Zone VI)
because if it gets really windy they can fly around and break the ground
glass, plus they tend to add weight. A Velcro on the side which is used
arround the camera is nice to maintain it in place. For good viewing of
the image with slow lenses, I have found that a second velcro is called.
One part of the velcro is on the left side of the cloth, the other one
on the right side, so that you can close totally the cloth (light coming
from under the cloth is otherwise quite distracting). Darkroom
Innovations have taken this idea seriously and makes a darkcloth with an
elasticized collar that fits around the camera and a velcro-closed slit
that you can close totally for excellent darkness. The choice of
material makes it light and windproof. It&rsquo;s better than any other
darkcloth that I have seen.</p>

<h3 id="focussing-aid">Focussing aid</h3>

<p>Except maybe in 8x10, don&rsquo;t trust the naked eye to focus critically. A
lupe with a medium magnification, not too big, not too expensive, is the
best here. This eliminates the lupes which are usually used for viewing
slides on light tables. Unlike in that situation, to focus the view
camera you don&rsquo;t need a high quality lupe. On the other hand, there are
a few practical requirements: its skirt does not prevent from viewing
the corners, it is focussable so that you can make sure it is focussed
on the ground glass, and it has attachement for a string so that you can
dangle it around your neck. I like the Calumet lupe (7x) for its small
size and good magnification. It works well with my very fine-grained
Boss Screen but when I had the coarser Canham stock screen, I found it
easier to focus with the Toyo (4x). Some people like cheap +4 dioptre
glasses. Ron Wisner uses (and sells) a linen tester (an inexpensive
folding magnifier that you put in your pocket, and which can be angled
for good corner viewing). &ldquo;Hastings Triplets&rdquo; used by geologists are
similar, but more powerful.</p>

<h3 id="cable-release">Cable release</h3>

<p>In order to avoid loosing them or spending time to screw/unscrew them, I
have a cable release permanently attached to each of my lenses.</p>

<h3 id="meter">Meter</h3>

<p>The Pentax digital spot meter seems to be popular with large format
photographers. It is relatively small and light, reliable, and has easy
controls and viewfinder readings. Recently the multi-purpose Sekonic
Zoom-master has been succesfull, because it combines incident and flash
with spot. However it is more complex and does not have viewfinder
displays.</p>

<p>Personnally I use my 35mm camera. I like to have the small camera to be
able to shoot quickly should something change suddently and produce many
images for stock. I also use it as a viewfinder so I don&rsquo;t have to move
the tripod around. When I am in a hurry, I use the matrix metering,
otherwise I use the a built-in spot meter with the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> stop analog scale
in the viewfinder. I just set the same shutter speed and f-stop I intend
to use on the LF camera, and then see where different part of the scene
fall. Cameras with such a scale include the Nikon N8008s, F4, F5, F100
(N90 has only a f1 stop scale), and most canons, including the Rebel
2000 and the EOS 3. If I use the polarizer on the LF camera, I just put
a polariser on my 35mm lens. The 24-120 or 24-85 lenses matches all the
4 focals that I commonly use on the LF camera.</p>

<h3 id="better-focussing-screen">Better focussing screen</h3>

<p>You can replace the focussing screen which comes with your camera, or
supplement it with a fresnel lens to obtain a brighter and/or sharper
image. After several screens, I have found the Boss screen to be by far
the best.</p>
