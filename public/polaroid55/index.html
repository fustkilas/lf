<p>Large Format Photography: Polaroid type 55</p>

<h2 id="polaroid-type-55">Polaroid type 55</h2>

<p><strong>By Jean-David Beyer for <a href=".">the Large Format Page</a></strong></p>

<p>You should look into Ansel Adams&rsquo; book, &ldquo;Polaroid Land Photography&rdquo;, New
York Graphic Society, 1963, if you can get a copy. I assume it is still
in print. Good libraries will have it, or get it on inter-library loan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>1.) Polaroid recommends clearing the film with a bath composed
of 180 grams sodium sulfite in 1 litre of water.
2.) If you then wish to harden them, a bath containing, in 1 litre
28% acetic acid         250 ml
Potassium alum          16 gram
3.) Don Leavitt, in Popular Photography, November 1966 recommended
combining the results of 1 and 2 (not the solutions themselves)
by using in 1 litre

Potassium alum          30 gram
sodium bislufite        60 gram
water to                1 litre

Note that this solution gives off an irritating gas; probably
sulfur dioxide. I keep it in a glass bottle with a metal screw-on
cap. It ultimately dissolves the metal cap, but not in a day or two.
Plastic containers, provided they do not leak, would probably be
better than what I use in many ways. The advantage of this solution
is that &quot;the negatives may be stacked together in a small
container, without dividers, since the negatives harden as they clear
and thus are less susceptible to scratching.&quot;
4.)Ansel considered this (normal processing) &quot;quite permanent&quot;.
However,
5.) &quot;Whenever archival treatment is desired, use the following
procedure after compliting the sulfite clearing and acid-hardening
process:
        1.) Rinse negatives.
        2.) Fix in a standard fixing bath (F-5 or F-6) for 3-4 minutes.
                Do not use rapid fixers.
        3.) Rinse.
        4.) Treat for 2-3 minutes in a hypo-clearing bath to which a
                small amount of Kodak slelenium toner has been added
                (about 1:20).
        5.) Rinse.
        6.) Wash thuroughly.
        7.) Immerse in fresh solution of wetting agent solution
                (Kodak Photo-Flo, for example) for a minute or so.
        8.) Hang up to dry in a clean area.
        9.) When thuroughly dry, store in chemically safe envelopes
                in a cool, dry area.&quot;

6.) Most users find that using an EI of 20-25 for 55 will give the
best negatives, whereas an EI of 64 is best for the print. This may
vary some from batch-to-batch, but not much.
