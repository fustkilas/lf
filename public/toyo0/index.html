<p>Large Format Photography: Toyo metal field 5x7</p>

<h2 id="toyo-metal-field-5x7">Toyo metal field 5x7</h2>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.terragalleria.com/">Q.-Tuan Luong</a> for <a href=".">the Large
Format Page</a></strong></p>

<p>This camera seems to be an earlier model (probably from the 50&rsquo;s) which
was a basic 4.75 x 6.5 camera. The camera body is a metallic gray/silver
&ldquo;hammertone&rdquo; finish. It simply says &ldquo;Toyo Field&rdquo;. It came with a
descriptive leaflet claiming that it is the first metal field camera
ever built. Various backs were available and I got one with a 5x7 back,
which is rare. The design of the camera is quite classical for a metal
field, and is inspired by the graphics. The only geared movement is the
front focussing, and there is no calibration scales.</p>

<p>This camera has a number of extremely good features, making it very good
for most of landscape photography:</p>

<ul>
<li>a quite cheap (\$650) perfectly usable 5x7 camera</li>
<li>lightweight (6lbs), very compact (as thin as a Tachihara 4x5) but
metal construction, which makes it rugged and rigid</li>
<li>very easy to open and to close (takes less than 30 seconds)</li>
<li>the knobs are of a decent size and are rubberized unlike on most
cameras, therefore more pleasant to operate in cold weather</li>
<li>there is a bail arm for easy opening of the ground glass</li>
<li>the short bellows allow a good amount of rise even with a 120 lens</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there is some shortcomings. The most serious is:</p>

<ul>
<li>limited bellows draw. The camera has about 14 inches of bellows,
which is really short for a 5x7 camera, and does not allow any long
lens to be used, even at infinity. The telephoto lenses available
just cover 5x7 with almost no movements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other features which I miss are:</p>

<ul>
<li>4x5 back (actually, there was one, but now it&rsquo;s almost impossible to
find)</li>
<li>more movements. The camera in particular has front tilt and swing
and rise/fall, but lacks back swings (which might be a problem if a
lens with small coverage is to be used).</li>
<li>wide angle bellows. Although shifts can be applied to the limit of
coverage of the 120, the bellows provoke some internal vignetting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The camera uses Graphic lensboard, which is a plus for Graphic camera
users, and a minus if you want to share lenses with other cameras. These
lensboard are quite cheap, though.</p>
