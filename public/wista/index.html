<p>Large Format Photography:The Wista metal field camera</p>

<h2 id="the-wista-metal-field-camera">The Wista metal field camera</h2>

<p><strong>A quick review by <a href="mailto:acs@cs.toronto.edu">Alvin Chia-Hua Shih</a> for
<a href="/">largeformatphotography.info</a></strong></p>

<p>Likes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interchangeable bellows. I believe it&rsquo;s the only field camera that
can boast of that.</li>
<li>Reasonably solid (being metal).</li>
<li>Extension track can be displaced back for shorter lenses. I was
using it with a 90, but looked as though it could take a 75 on the
track.</li>
<li>Geared front rise and tilt.</li>
<li>Thoughtful little clip for keeping the film holder in. (But didn&rsquo;t
help for Polaroid 545.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
<li>No zero detents for rise and tilt. (I don&rsquo;t know why I found this
particularly irritating, but I did.)</li>
<li>Fresnel and hood not sufficient for good viewing on sunny days.
(Still need a dark cloth.)</li>
<li>Fresnel blacks out when viewed from off-axis.</li>
<li>No friction lock for front swing.</li>
<li>Changing bellows in the field is pretty fiddly.</li>
<li>Rotating back. There&rsquo;s no friction lock on it, and the 90-degree
detents still allow a bit of play. So I was never confident that
putting the film back in didn&rsquo;t rotate the back by .5 degree.</li>
<li>Rangefinder (on Wista RF only) got in the way of putting in the
Polaroid back. I had to stuff the holder in from the bottom.</li>
<li>Recessed Linhof lensboards holding Copal 1 shutters can pose
problems for attaching cable releases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but the SP has the rear swing controlled by
knobs, right? I played with that one in the store and didn&rsquo;t like it. If
I cranked the swing control all the way and then cranked it back,
something would catch on the other side causing &ldquo;swing&rdquo; (extension,
actually) in the other direction. But perhaps it responds better for
moderate movements?</p>
