<p>This is a list of recommendations for books about and of Large format
photography, that I, and other contributors have found useful or

to add the title and a short description. I&rsquo;ll periodically update the
main pages. By clicking on the image or the title of each book, you can
read more about it, and even buy it from amazon.com (and support the

genre.</li>
<li><a href="architecture.html">Architecture</a>. This is a natural application of

call for a strict control of perspective made possible only by
camera movements.</li>
<li><a href="human.html">The Human figure</a>. Although the large format camera is

it was actually used to produce some of the masterpieces of the nude
and portrait photography in a wide range of styles.</li>
