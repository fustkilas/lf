<h2 id="a-review-of-the-sinar-a1">A review of the Sinar A1</h2>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.dnai.com/~hamish/">Hamish Reid</a> Copyright Â© 1994</strong></p>

<p>*The A1 was discontinued in 97. It was quite similar to the current F1.
<strong>Editor</strong>*</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve dragged it for a month around the Mojave, up to (but not
up!) Mt Shasta, across Emeryville, Berkeley, and Oakland, and generally
used it for everything I could - urban and natural landscapes, still
life stuff, architecture, etc., both colour and black and white.</p>

<p>The Sinar A1 is Sinar&rsquo;s cheap (US \$850) 4x5 introductory or beginner&rsquo;s
version of the F1 (being, in fact, the F1 in all but name, rail, and
rail attachments, as far as I can tell). Sinar sells it with a four year
full price-back arrangement if you trade up to a more expensive Sinar
model; you also get a reasonable case for the A1 included in the price
(the case also fits lenses, spare bellows, and backs in with the body).</p>

<p>The A1 has friction movements and geared rear focusing; the movements
are roughly 70mm rise/fall and shift, at least 35 degrees swing and
(base) tilt (all figures for each standard). The A1 has an easy-to-use
tilt, swing, and depth of field / f-stop calculator built in. Bellows
are fully interchangeable (and come in three increasingly wide-angle
models). The film back is not rotatable, but is easily taken out and put
back vertically or horizontally without much fuss. Maximum bellows
extension is with the standard rail is 19&rdquo;; there is also a 6&rdquo; rail
extension available. Minimum extension is a function of lens rear
element size when using the wide angle bellows. The rail attaches to
both <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; screw mounts.</p>

<p>Sinar provide a few pricey accesories like binocular reflex viewing
hoods, etc, but third party accesories like the Calumet roll film back,
filter holders, lens shades, etc. work well with the Sinar (it&rsquo;s worth
remembering too that Horseman accesories and lensboards generally fit
Sinar models).</p>

<p>The setup I used included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sinar A1 4x5 body (new)</li>
<li>Normal and wide-angle bellows (new)</li>
<li>Nikkor 180mm/f5.6 &ldquo;W&rdquo; series lens (new)</li>
<li>Schneider 90mm/f8 lens (rented)</li>
<li>Sinar lensboard safety catch thing (new)</li>
<li>Sinar binocular reflex viewing hood (rented)</li>
<li>Polaroid 545 back (rented)</li>
<li>Calumet C2N roll film back (new)</li>
<li>Bogen 3036 tripod and 3029 head.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rented items were from Gasser&rsquo;s in San Francisco.</p>

<p>In summary, the A1 is a nice way to get into 4x5 if you don&rsquo;t mind
either getting third party accessories or can put up with Sinar&rsquo;s prices
(\$2,200 for a roll film back?). The A1 is light, strong, has adequate
movements, is easy to use, and produces good results. I have only minor
criticisms, all of which are covered in a later paragraph.</p>

<p>Oh, and it also attracts curious crowds wherever you go&hellip;.</p>

<h3 id="background-uses">Background &amp; Uses</h3>

<p>I was relatively new to large format photography when I decided to buy
the Sinar. At the time (several years ago now&hellip;), I&rsquo;d been using a
Pentax 6x7 for several years, and while I liked the 6x7&rsquo;s sharp and
essentially grain-free results, I needed movements - especially front
standard rise and tilt &ndash; for the various streetscapes and landscapes I
do.</p>

<p>Most of my large-format photography is either landscapes (urban, desert,
California&rsquo;s Central Valley, mountains, etc.), architecture, or high art
(the usual nonsense). I did not want to use it much for portraits or
commercial still-life / product stuff, but I didn&rsquo;t want to pre-empt
this either.</p>

<h3 id="likes">Likes</h3>

<p>So what did I <em>like</em> about the A1? In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Price, availablitity, and support - last year I almost bought the
cheap Calumet 45NX (then US \$599), but lost my nerve. When it came
to do it again, the Calumet had increased in price to about \$700,
and I couldn&rsquo;t try it before buying it. So the A1 with case and
money-back upgrade seemed more attractive this time.</p>

<p>In the end, though, what made me go with the Sinar was really the
store support here - I walked into Gasser&rsquo;s and they cheerfully let
me play with the body (and several lenses, etc.) for an hour or
two - no rush - and were happy to talk about the pros and cons of
the various options. They knew a lot about it, and they&rsquo;re only a
cheap phone call or short drive away from here. (I also played with
one of the Horseman models at Gasser&rsquo;s, but it was hideously
expensive; I also got to look at the Technikarden, but that was
really only to get a feel for how the other half live).</p></li>

<li><p>Sturdiness and light weight - this body is light (about 3Kg, I
think), which is important out in the field. This lightness is not a
function of flimsiness - the body&rsquo;s been thrown into the back of a
car many times already, and survived being roughly handled.</p></li>

<li><p>The interchangeable components (bellows, backs, lensboards, etc.)
all fitted together well and generally worked well together. The
various methods for attaching backs, etc. have a high quality feel
to them, and seem to work. Things &ldquo;click&rdquo; (metaphorically and
really) into place. Reminds me a bit of the Hasselblad, but maybe
not quite so nice (nor as foolproof, much to my chagrin).</p></li>

<li><p>The DOF and tilt caclulators - these seem to be a good idea, and
appear to have worked so far, but see some of the comments below
about them. In general, they&rsquo;re easy to use and (if you trust them)
almost automatic after a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Smooth movements (except for rise and fall - see below). In general,
all the movements feel smooth and are easy to use.</p></li>

<li><p>The geared rear fine focus is nice.</p></li>

<li><p>The case was a pleasant surprise - I&rsquo;d expected to spend another few
hundred dollars or so on a case, but it came with the unit. The case
is actually useful, and fits pretty much what I needed - roll film
back, extra lens, etc. while also storing the body with rail and
lens attached.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-points-hints-etc">Other Points / Hints Etc.</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Sinar sells a little claw / hook sort of thing to stop the lensboard
falling off the front standard when you pull the lensboard detach
lever (clearly I can&rsquo;t remember its real name).</p>

<p>This is worth its weight in gold (and it only costs about \$16) -
it&rsquo;s remarkably easy to pull the lever unintentionally when you
meant to pull the bellows release lever or without getting a good
grip on the lensboard - and this little accesory has saved my skin
already. I leave mine on all the time.</p></li>

<li><p>The binocular reflex hood was worth renting, if not buying
(\$700&hellip;). It&rsquo;s a lot of help in urban settings where speed is
essential; it works well outdoors with the brighter subjects even
without a fresnel lens. Frankly, I&rsquo;m still having trouble with an
image that is both upside-down and laterally reversed, so the hood
helped a lot with this too.</p></li>

<li><p>This is not so much a Sinar design problem as brain failure on my
part, but I can&rsquo;t believe the number of times I&rsquo;ve forgotten to lock
the back standard coarse focus, meaning I stand there fine-focusing
back and forth for a while wondering why nothing&rsquo;s changing as the
focus bed moves up and down the rail leaving the rear standard
motionless.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="detailed-peeves">Detailed Peeves</h3>

<p>Again, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The front and back rise and fall are often &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; and difficult to
use smoothly. This is not a function of the bellows getting in the
way (comparable shifts work well, but the bellows do make a
difference in some cases), but of the design - the posts rise and
fall through a mechanism that seems designed to make it hard to move
without a lot of effort, meaning you nearly always over-shoot. The
standard detents are also far too easy to miss as you blunder up and
down. The back standard rise / fall lock is also a bit difficult to
use, being too hard to lock / unlock (the front version is fine).</p>

<p>This does all get better with time and practice, and I&rsquo;ve pretty
much mastered the art of getting just the right rise out of the
mechanism on demand, but it&rsquo;s still irritating - especially since
front rise is by far the most common movement I use at the moment.</p></li>

<li><p>The rail / tripod attachment mechanism is primitive and doesn&rsquo;t
inspire much confidence. It&rsquo;s always worked, and appears to work OK,
but it&rsquo;s sort of hard to trust this flimsy-looking sliding square of
aluminium to hold your vast investment safely on top of the tripod.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also an awful fiddle to attach to the tripod head because it
slides too easily in the rail, meaning it always disappears one way
or another as you try to mate it to the thread on the tripod head.
Yes, I need to buy a better head attachment. One day&hellip;.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s far too easy to accidentally swing the rear standard when
putting film backs in. The rear standard swing/shift lock needs to
be really tight before you open the back - and I mean <em>really</em>
tight. This gets to be routine after a while, but I initially spent
a lot of time refocusing due to this - and getting even more annoyed
when my tightening the swing lock caused the tripod head itself to
rotate. A real comedy of errors for the spectator&hellip;.</p></li>

<li><p>Shift and swing adjustments use the same lock on each standard,
making it a bit too easy to change both when you only meant to
change one.</p>

<p>Additionally, there&rsquo;s no zero detent on the front or rear standard
shift movements (but the swings have zero detents). The movements
themselves are nice and smooth, but you can&rsquo;t judge whether they&rsquo;re
centred without looking at the scale; this is a pain for front
standard shifts.</p></li>

<li><p>You might not like the base tilts (yes, you have to refocus). This
hasn&rsquo;t fazed me much, but I don&rsquo;t have any experience with axial
tilts, so I can&rsquo;t really comment.</p></li>

<li><p>The trade-up offer may not be as useful as it looks. Given that a)
the A1 is an F1 (and almost an F2) in all but name and rails, and b)
the first Sinar with fully-geared movements costs somewhere around
\$3-6,000, if you&rsquo;re looking to get something better after the A1 /
F1 / F2, you might be better off going with the cheaper Calumet,
Toyo or even Horseman geared models rather than the Sinar,
particularly if you want geared movements. This makes me a little
wary about buying Sinar accesories (like the binocular reflex lens
hood I covet). On the other hand, I can&rsquo;t see myself trading up
anyway - I never seem to get rid of old camera gear, and the A1
looks like it has a long useful life ahead of it.
Sinar certainly seem to concentrate on the high end and digital
market (i.e. over \$10,000 per basic body). I&rsquo;ve got to admit that I
like what I&rsquo;ve seen of these high end Sinars, but I&rsquo;ll never be able
to afford them&hellip;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>[]{#comparison}</p>

<h2 id="differences-between-f1-f2-p2">Differences between F1,F2,P2</h2>

<p>I think the features of F2 over F1 are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Front micro focus</li>
<li>seperate control locks for shift &amp; swing (F1 uses the same lever to
lock both)</li>
<li>F2&rsquo;s a bit heavier</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bruce Barrett</strong></p>

<p>One other important difference between the F1 and the F2 is the monorail
block on the front standard. The F2 has a front standard block that
encircles the monorail like the rear standard block. The F1 has the
old-style hinged clamp that can be opened and slid over the middle of
the rail. The problem with this style is what I consider to be a design
flaw. If you are not EXTREMELY CAREFUL when tightening the clamp, you
will break the plastic around the clamp hinge and it will not tighten
well. I have been through two rail blocks for the front standard of my
F+ because of this problem. If the price of a front F2 standard was not
so high (over \$500) I would upgrade my existing camera. If I were
contemplating the purchase of the F1 or F2, I would fork out the extra
\$\$\$ for the F2 based on the block design alone. <strong>Bruce Clarke</strong></p>

<p>Just a few comments from someone who did step up from a Sinar F2 to a
Sinar P2. The F2 is a really excellent camera for almost every kind of
work. It&rsquo;s only real deficiency is the lack of precision drives for the
movements. In fact, I went to the P2 because I do a lot of studio work,
and some of it entails very precise repeatable settings, and the P2
really shines. Also, with the P2&rsquo;s assymetrical swings and tilts, you
see the image adjusting as you apply movements&hellip;so that you can control
depth of field, zones of sharpness, ans perspective with incredible
ease. With the F series you have to go through a dual focussing routine
and read off an angle and then move and re-focus. The P2 is just a lot
faster, and you see it all happen..it is truly a marvelous piece of
precision machinery. The great thing was that in the process of doing
the upgrade, I was able to use every Sinar accessory I have with the new
camera. The Sinar system is very compreh comprehensive (as are the
prices!!!!). I have been able to get excellent used bits and pieces for
between 33 and 50 % off new prices, and have thus been able to add to my
system. And&hellip;I have used the P2 outside for architectural photography,
and although it is heavier than the F2, it still is quite portable&hellip;but
I wouldn&rsquo;t take the thing on a hike! <strong>Brian Segal</strong></p>
