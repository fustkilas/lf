<h2 id="a-review-of-the-f-line">A review of the F-line</h2>

<p><strong>by Barry Sherman, Copyright Â© 1994</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this camera for a little more than 1 year, have used it
on several one and two week photo trips and have little inclination to
use anything else.</p>

<p>Please note that throughout this there&rsquo;s a noticible prejudice against
folding field cameras and that this is not intended to be a
pronouncement of a universal law, but merely my own preference showing
through.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The Arca Swiss F-Line provides full monorail movements while weighing
and bulking no more than most of the more capable folding field cameras.
I like the camera a lot and have yet to find a camera for which I&rsquo;d
trade it. (Well, maybe a Carbon Infinity, but I&rsquo;d hesitate for fear of
not being able to get that one repaired. Besides which, I haven&rsquo;t won
the lottery yet.)</p>

<p>The camera just does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do quickly, easily and
doesn&rsquo;t get in my way. It&rsquo;s hard to ask for more.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-was-looking-for">What I was looking for</h3>

<p>I wanted a 4x5 camera light enough to carry in a backpack for distances
up to a few miles, rugged enough to carry thusly and with enough
movements to use for architectural and table-top photography as well as
landscapes. I wanted a &ldquo;one-camera-does-everything&rdquo; camera because I
didn&rsquo;t want to have to buy another view camera for a good long while.</p>

<p>In addition, the camera needed to be quick to set up, something which
most folding field cameras appear to me not to be (IMHO, of course).
(Note: John Sparks reports that it takes him no longer to set up his
Canham 8x10 than it does me to set up my Arca Swiss 4x5, except that the
Arca Swiss can be stored with lens attached.)</p>

<p>The major contenders for my interest were the Wisner Technical and the
Linhof Technikardan. The Linhof Technika would have been a contender
save for the price of the more recent models. I chose the Arca because
it has movements equal to or greater than any of these cameras, weighs
in the same ballpark and, while it will not focus lenses as long as will
the Wisner or the Technikardan, it has the advantage of being part of a
monorail system, allowing expansion of its capacities.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll try to offend as many people as possible :-) :</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t consider the Sinar A1 because it&rsquo;s just too bulky for my
tastes, didn&rsquo;t consider the Zone VI because of reports from too many
people that the fit of the pieces and quality control aren&rsquo;t up to snuff
(but boy they sure are purty! :-), didn&rsquo;t consider the Horseman, Toyo or
Wista metal field cameras because their movements and bellows draw are
more restrictive than I want and didn&rsquo;t consider the Toyo VX125 (sp?)
because it hadn&rsquo;t been introduced at the time and besides which it costs
far more than I&rsquo;d be willing to spend.</p>

<h3 id="specs">Specs</h3>

<pre><code>NOTE:  the &quot;normal&quot; position of the front and rear standard rise/fall
       is all the way down.  Thus the spec. for rise/fall is actually
       for rise alone for each standard, although one may certainly
       chose to zero each standard at the midpoint of this movement.

NOTE:  When I went to write this I found that I no longer have the
       factory specs on this camera and so everything that I state here
       is from my own manual measurements.  Thus there may be some
       discrepency from published factory specs.


Max. Flange Focal Length:  (bellows draw)     15 5/8 inches  (382mm)

Min. Flange Focal Length:  (bellows draw)     2 inches (50mm) with
optional wide-angle bellows installed

Rise:              + 4 inches (98mm) both front and rear

Shift:             +/- 3.25 inches (75mm) either side of &quot;zero&quot;
           both front and rear

Swing:             limited by bellows front and rear

Base Tilt:         +/- 30 degrees front and rear

Axis Tilt:         none

Geared Movements:  front and rear focusing only.

Back type:         graflok

Back movements:    switches between horizontal and
           vertical in seconds but doesn't rotate

&quot;Zero detents&quot;:    All movements except for rise, which
           is normally in the full-down position

Weight:            7.5 lbs.  NOTE:  Specs say that the Linhof Master
                                    Technika weighs 7.0 lbs and the 
                                    Wisner Technical weighs 6.5 lbs.

Cost:              I paid $1,900 for the body, new

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>I carry this camera the way that others carry a folding field camera and
am able to do this because of the way that it disassembles. The monorail
actually consists of three pieces. There&rsquo;s one piece about 12 inches
long which attaches to the tripod. Atop this, sliding in &ldquo;dovetails&rdquo; in
the bottom piece, are two shorter pieces each about 6 inches long. Each
of these is locked in place by a cam-action lever and can be slid to the
front or rear as appropriate and then locked in place to increase the
overall length of the monorail. Thus you can leave the two upper
segments touching and have a 12 inch monorail or slide them apart and
have one nearly 18 inches long.</p>

<p>The front and rear standards of the camera slide onto these upper
monorail pieces and move along them to provide focusing. Thus, you can
move the front standard onto the upper front monorail segment, move the
rear standard onto the upper rear monorail segment and then separate
these segments by sliding them forward and backward as appropriate to
attain the full 15 <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch (flange focal length) extension.</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s time to put the camera away, you slide the two upper monorail
segments together so that they form one continuous rail and then slide
both the front and rear standard onto one of the upper segments. After
locking the standards in place with the focus lock, you can unlock that
upper monorail segment itself and remove it, with front and rear
standards attached to it, from the lower monorail arm. This reduces the
camera to a size very little larger than most folding field cameras, be
they wood or metal. Next the lower monorail segment, with the remaining
upper segment attached, is removed from the tripod and put in the
backpack.</p>

<p>Obviously, setup is the opposite of this operation and goes very
quickly. Just attach the lower monorail segment to the tripod, slide the
upper segment with both standards attached onto the lower segment, move
the two standards the appropriate distance apart and the camera&rsquo;s ready
to go.</p>

<p>Very few people can get a folding field camera set up in the 15 seconds
that it usually takes me to set up the Arca Swiss. (not counting setting
up the tripod, of course) This speed is abetted by the fact that I can
leave the lens attached, something that one cannot do with most folding
field cameras.</p>

<p>On the down side, the camera doesn&rsquo;t fold up into a box, and doesn&rsquo;t
provide protection for the groundglass. But I&rsquo;ve only had one problem
with damage to the camera and that was caused by improper packing on my
part when I checked the camera in its soft backpack as airline baggage.
I now load the entire backpack and tripod into a very large hard-sided
suitcase and then check *that*. And I find that a Calumet groundglass
protector prevents damage to the groundglass quite nicely since I
reinforced it with a second thickness of ABS plastic. (No, it wasn&rsquo;t the
Arca groundglass that was broken before I reinforced the protector - it
was the Bender Kit groundglass.)</p>

<h3 id="what-i-like">What i like</h3>

<ul>
<li>The camera&rsquo;s really rigid. My previous two cameras were a Bender Kit
which was not very rigid at all and a Calumet 400 series which was
also not very rigid. By comparison, this thing&rsquo;s a tank. Of course,
it&rsquo;s pretty wobbly compared to a 15-20 lb. studio monorail, but few
people will carry a studio monorail into the field. Anyway, nothing
moves out of alignment when locked and when inserting film holders.</li>

<li><p>Movements work very nicely. I don&rsquo;t really notice the lack of
gearing on them. Controls are well thought out and logical in
placement. Nearly mnemonic. Locks lock without having to use
excessive force.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been caught in a sandstorm while photographing with the Arca
and 1) Was able to continue working afterward, despite definite
grittiness in the movements and 2) was able to clean the sand and
dust out of the mechanisms easily later that day back at the motel.
The mechanisms are easy to disassemble and reassemble if you have
the right tools - just a couple of small hex-wrenches and
screwdrivers.</p></li>

<li><p>The wide-angle bellows is a dream. This is not a bag but rather a
pleated leather bellows made from incredibly soft leather and with
really large pleats. It&rsquo;s so supple that even at the minimum flange
focal length of 2 inches I can get 2 inches of rise from the
standards. That&rsquo;s incredible! Granted, that&rsquo;s far more rise than any
short lens could provide in its image circle. I mention it only as
an illustration of how supple the bellows is. In addition, it
extends long enough to use it with a 210mm lens provided that only
modest movements are being used.</p>

<p>Similarly, the regular bellows is usable with lenses down to 135mm,
provided that only moderate movements are used or with a 90mm lens
if very minimal movements are used. What this means is that I don&rsquo;t
have to change between the two bellows very often.</p>

<p>Even better, the wide-angle bellows doesn&rsquo;t protrude into the light
path as have some bag bellows that I&rsquo;ve used. I&rsquo;ve used bag bellows
which had to be carefully pulled and adjusted after the camera was
set up because they&rsquo;d deform and protrude into the light path. This
Arca Swiss wide-angle bellows, through some magical properties of
physics unknown to me, never does this.</p>

<p>Now for the downside: the price of the wonderful leather wide-angle
bellows was \$500. Ouch! They also make a synthetic wide-angle
bellows for <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> that price but I couldn&rsquo;t locate any when I bought
the camera and so bit the bullet and got the leather one. Now that
I&rsquo;ve absorbed the cost I&rsquo;m glad that I did as it&rsquo;s really a joy to
work with, but it really hurt at first.</p>

<p>An extension bellows, required if lenses longer than 300mm in a
normal lens or 500mm in a telephoto design are to be used, costs,
you guessed it, about \$500. This has kept me from extending the
capabilities of the camera to date. That and not having the money
for a longer lens anyway.</p></li>

<li><p>The camera comes with a built-in fresnel lens which works better
than those which I&rsquo;ve used in the past.</p></li>

<li><p>Camera has &ldquo;zero detents&rdquo; on all movements. A delightful convenience
after the Bender which has zero detents on no movements and the
Calumet, whose zero detents were inoperable due to rust. (Apparently
the zero detents were the one place that I failed to clean after the
Calumet went swimming in the Pacific Ocean. :-)</p></li>

<li><p>I was worried that, after being accustomed to center tilts, I&rsquo;d find
base tilts difficult to use. Not only do I not find this to be the
case, I really like the ease of being able to combine both swing and
tilt on the same standard without getting weird distortions caused
by yaw. Certainly, with my other two cameras with their center tilts
I can avoid yaw by using the cameras tilted 90 degrees on their
sides, but that&rsquo;s a pain in the neck.</p></li>

<li><p>The person who sold the camera to me commented that I&rsquo;d be surprised
at how quickly the camera would just kind of fade into the
background and do what I wanted it to, compared to some of the
hassles that I&rsquo;d had with the Bender and the Calumet.
He was right.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-i-dislike-about-it">What I dislike about it</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The lens boards are ludicrously large - nearly 7 inches square! Way
to large to store several lenses in a backpack.</p>

<p>All is not lost, however, as Keith Canham, maker of the Canham view
cameras, has produced an adaptor which allows one to use Linhof
Technika style lens boards on the Arca Swiss. So my lenses are
mounted in Technika style (actually they&rsquo;re labeled Wista) lens
boards. This adaptor is on the one Arca lens board that I have which
stays mounted on the camera at all times.</p>

<p>Naturally, the cost of the adaptor was \$250 (rather a lot, I
think). And I&rsquo;m not completely satisfied with the quality of the
adaptor as a couple of anodized studs and a leaf spring both show
signs of rust after spending a couple of weeks in Hawaii. This
doesn&rsquo;t seem to reflect the level of quality that I expected, given
the name of the manufacturor and the price. But the adaptor
*works* just fine and I&rsquo;m pleased with it overall. I&rsquo;d never have
considered using this camera in the field without being able to use
smaller lens boards and this makes it possible.</p></li>

<li><p>I cannot remove the fresnel lens if I want to as focus shifts
minutely when I do. The fresnel lens and groundglass are mounted
such that the fresnel lens is *not* acting as a spacer for the
groundglass, but for some reason focus definitely shifts when I try
to remove it. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s one of the better groundglass
brightening systems that I&rsquo;ve used so I don&rsquo;t mind it too much, but
I&rsquo;d prefer to have options here.</p></li>

<li><p>Support sucks. This may have improved, however. But at the time that
I bought it, there was no official Arca distributor in the U.S. The
person from whom I bought it, a salesman in a camera store near
Phoenix AZ, assured me that his connections with people at the
manufacturor in Switzerland would allow him to obtain parts easily.
And he was most prompt about shipping the camera and other
accessories to me.</p>

<p>But when the camera was broken by airline baggage handlers (actually
by my own poor packing), it took 6 months and several phone calls to
get the repair parts. As it happened, I was able to mend it
immediately on my own but I felt more comfortable having officially
unbroken parts and was not at all pleased with the slow response. It
appeared strongly to me that my broken camera was not a high
priority with this person and my view of hims is somewhat jaundiced
as a result. (I.e. he did not appear to me to pursue matters with
the people in Switzerland with any great zeal.)</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;ve seen ads in magazines which indicate that there is now
an official Arca Swiss distributor for the U.S. so accessories and
parts may now be easier to come by. Plus, the person from whom I
bought it has told me that he&rsquo;s a distributor for the SW U.S. so I
have some hope.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s a little heavier than I&rsquo;d like. Like about 3-4 lbs heavier. But
most every other camera which has the features that I want weighs in
the same ballpark so I&rsquo;m not really complaining. And if I want to
walk more than a few miles then I can always trade the Arca for the
Bender Kit which only weighs 3 lbs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that I&rsquo;m not coming up with any real user complaints? That&rsquo;s
because I don&rsquo;t have any!</p>

<li>The metal surfaces are not black-anodized.</li>
<li>The rail doesn&rsquo;t collapse/expand.</li>
<li>There are flash shoes on the front and rear standards(!).</li>
<li>No fresnel.</li>

</ol>

<p>The lens boards and rails are supposedly compatible, but the bellows are
not. Worse, I rented a 90mm lens (Caltar II-N) on a recessed lens board
and discovered that the construction of the camera won&rsquo;t permit infinity
focus with this lens! <strong>Alvin Chia-Hua Shih</strong></p>

<h4 id="older-and-newer-f-line-models">Older and newer F-line models</h4>

<p>The older style F-line standards definitely fit on the newer high
profile rails.</p>

<p>However, you might contact Rod Klukas at Photomark. He currently has a
bunch of the older style rails and bridges at a good price (a couple of
folding low profile rail). Photomark is at 602-244-1133. Patience is
sometimes necessary as he&rsquo;s got a lot of business&hellip;.</p>

<p>There is at least two folding low profile rails(from two FC cameras) and
a longer bridge with a section of low profile rails. (Excellent
condition)</p>

<p>BTW here&rsquo;s the differences between the older and newer style F-line Arca
Swiss Rails: (bridge = the unit that the rail goes into for attachment
to the tripod. It comes in many sizes, from about 3 inches up thru a
meter long section)(sometimes the bridge is called a bracket in the
literature).</p>
