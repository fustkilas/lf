<p>Arca Swiss 6 x 9 FC: a review</p>

<h2 id="arca-swiss-6-x-9-fc-a-review">Arca Swiss 6 x 9 FC: a review</h2>

<p><strong>By <a href="mailto:jocome@cris.com">J. C. Metcalf</a> for <a href=".">the Large Format
Page</a></strong></p>

<p>For some reason the Arca Swiss 6 x 9 FC view camera tends to be
overlooked in reviews of this format. It shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p>The Arca Swiss 6x9 is a very high quality, easily transportable full
featured monorail camera. The camera is extremely compact. The &ldquo;FC&rdquo;
designates a monorail that folds in half for easy storage. For use, the
two monorail sections screw easily and quickly together. The front and
rear standards ride on geared blocks on the monorail. The monorail
itself slides into a 3.25&rdquo; dovetailed rail clamp that screws to the
tripod. An adjustable lever on the side of the clamp tightens it against
the monorail.</p>

<p>The Arca 6x9 FC has front and rear base tilts, front and rear side to
side sliding movements, 3&rdquo; of front rise and 3&rdquo; of rear rise, front and
rear swings. There are built in levels both front and rear. All
movements are smooth, sold and precise. In five years of pretty
demanding use I have never had a problem.</p>

<p>All movements can be locked with nicely designed and easy to use round
knobs that have never stuck. It comes with flat and recessed lens
boards. The standard rail is 12&rdquo; long and additional, longer, rails are
available. The standard bellows is 10&rdquo; and is an extremely flexible soft
pleated leather that is useable for the shortest lens I have (47mm
Schneider Super Angulon) to the longest I have (270mm Nikon Telephoto).
Longer bellows are available as is a wide angle bellows. The standard
bellows is really enough. The camera weighs just over 5 lbs. and is
easier to deal with than a Hasselblad. Why ?</p>

<ul>
<li>the 6x9 Arca itself packs up in less room than the Hasselblad (I&rsquo;ve
tested it!)</li>
<li>view camera lenses on lens board take up less room than comparable
slr lenses. Compare, for example the volume of Hassie 250mm with the
Nikon 270 tele or compare either the the 47mm schneider (very small)
or 58mm schneider (bigger but still smaller than 50mm Hassie) with
the 50mm Hassie. 6x9 normal lens is the Nikon 105mm, noticeably
smaller than Hassie 80mm standard lens. View camera lenses all stop
down further than slr lenses (due to simpler shutter design). If
you&rsquo;ve got standing aspen trees from 5 feet in front of the camera
to infinity you are glad to be able to stop down to f45. View camera
lenses, though certainly not cheap, cost less than comparable slr
lenses, again due to simpler design.</li>
<li>No extra close up attachments are needed with view camera - with
Hassie you need one or two extension tubes that do take up room.</li>
<li>the roll film backs for the Arca are about the same &ldquo;volume&rdquo; as the
Hassie - no real diff there.</li>
<li>ground glass viewing on the 6x9 view camera is much easier than
ground glass viewing on the Hassie. If you use one of the Hassie
viewing attachments you add significant weight and bulk. The ground
glass on the 6x9 Arca is small enough that rarely do I feel the need
for a focussing cloth, and when I do, I&rsquo;ve got a 2&rsquo;x2&rsquo; piece of dark
blue waterproof cordura nylon that works fine.</li>
<li>Not having view camera adjustments is, to me, a true inconvenience -
converging lines in buildings, out of focus foregrounds and
backgrounds are burrs under my saddle - maybe idiosyncratic, but I
can&rsquo;t help it!</li>
<li>the one feature the Hasselblad system has that I&rsquo;ve not been able to
duplicate with a view camera is the superb Hasselblad bellows lens
shade and the same diameter bayonet attachment on the front of all
lenses from 38mm to 250mm. To me this is very minor.</li>
</ul>

<p>FILM. Roll film backs are &ldquo;graflock&rdquo; style. To use the film back the
ground glass is removed. The roll film back then attaches to a roll film
back holder which then locks onto the camera back. The process of
removing the ground glass and attaching the film back to the holder and
camera takes less than 10 seconds. I use four backs (b &amp; w for &ldquo;normal,&rdquo;
&ldquo;plus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minus,&rdquo; development and one back for color.) One holder for
the film backs is adequate. Polaroid film packs are easily used with the
NPC Polaroid adapter or the Arca Swiss Polaroid adapter. The NPC I have
has been trouble free for 5 years and was about half the price of the
Arca Swiss item.</p>

<p>Conversion to 4 x 5 is a snap. The Arca Swiss 4 x 5 F and FC are
virtually identical (except size) to the 6x9. The 4x5 uses the same
monorail and monorail clamp as the 6x9. Therefore, to use 4x5 all you
need is a 4x5 back and the available tapered bellows that allows use of
the 6x9 front standard with the 4x5 back. You can then use the much
smaller 6x9 metal lensboards (4.25&rdquo; square). The 4x5 back is &ldquo;graflock&rdquo;
style meaning it can use roll film holders as well as standard sheet
film holders. Now Arca Swiss is offering something called the 4 x 5 FC
line Field. This new 4 x 5 is described as being a 4 x 5 camera with a 6
x 9 front and a tapered bellows. I assume this means that a camera one
could assemble by purchasing accessory parts is now offered as a unit. I
saw this &ldquo;new&rdquo; camera advertised by &ldquo;the F Stops here&rdquo; in Shutterbug -
but I haven&rsquo;t seen it in person. It does offer another &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; 4
x 5 option that will be somewhat more compact and lighter than the
previous off the shelf Arca Swiss 4 x 5. <em>NdE: I met on an Olympic NP
beach a photographer from Switzerland who was using the mixed 4x5 / 6x9
F-line camera with roll-film. He said that although he uses only
roll-film, he still prefered to use 4x5 so that he could do 6x12 (he had
a Sinar zoom back that the seemed to like a lot). His reason for using
the 6x9 camera was to save one pound of weight, and the smaller
lensboards.</em></p>

<p>I have had five years of experience with this camera. It has gone to
Europe four times. The camera, five lenses, four roll film holders,
eight screw in filters fit securely into a small Lightware medium format
case that can be carried on to your airplane and put in the overhead
luggage bin. The camera has made a number of domestic flights, been
backpacking around the Rocky Mountains, travelled the high plains, the
Utah desert, New Mexico and the Olympic Penninsula rain forest. I use it
often in the studio, especially for portraits and figures, in preference
to 4x5 and 8x10. Results? It has never disappointed. Modern lenses and
TMX 100 film (EI 64) developed in TMX RS give great results. 20&rdquo;x12.5&rdquo;
enlargments are astonishingly sharp - individual hairs, skin blemishes,
grass, twigs, leaves are crisp.</p>

<p>Price today is probably around \$2,500.00. Less expensive than Horseman
or Linhof medium format view cameras. Toyo is probably a little less
expensive. Horseman is less versatile. Linhof is comparable though not
quite as versative. Toyo is comparable in movements and versatility but
weighs 8.5lbs and is not as compact. Support - Calumet (<sup>800</sup>&frasl;<sub>225</sub>-8638)
now supplies and supports Arca Swiss. Calumet is reliable, trustworthy,
and if they don&rsquo;t have it they&rsquo;ll get it. The Calumet prices are better
than most retail outlets and the difference in price between Calumet and
New York discounters reflects the enhanced service and competence.</p>
