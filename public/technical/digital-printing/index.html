<p><em>Summary: an overview of the digital printers able of high-quality color
output in large format, including continuous-tone printers and inkjet
printers, as of July 2005.</em></p>

<p>While in B&amp;W, there is still a place for the traditional darkroom
despite recent advances in digital printing, most of fine art printing
in color is nowadays done digitally. The tools in the B&amp;W darkroom
always gave its practioners a tremendous amount of control. With the
exception of the dye-transfer process, it wasn&rsquo;t until the advent of
digital workflows that color photographers gained access to equally
powerful controls. However, dye transfer is extremely time-consuming,
expensive, and difficult. Availability of materials is problematic,
since the few remaining experts rely on stockpiles of discontinued
supplies. The tactile and visual qualities of the medium have always
played a large role in B&amp;W photography, and there is a considerable
range of possibilities. In color photography, the practical output
choices are limited between type-C prints and Ilfochrome/Cibachrome.
Digital printing not only includes those options, but adds quite a few
of its own.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-tone-digital-printers-lightjet-chromira-lambda">Continuous tone digital printers: Lightjet, Chromira, Lambda</h3>

<p>Continuous tone printers use photographic (silver-based) paper. The
image is created by exposing the paper pixel by pixel with RGB light
sources, either lasers or LEDs. Each pixel has a continuous 24 (8x3) bit
RGB value. Processing is done automatically in the printer with
traditional chemistry. The resulting prints look exactly like
traditionally made color photographs.</p>

<p>By far, the most commonly used papers are type-C (for printing from
negatives) processed in RA-4 chemistry. Of all the type-C papers, the
preferred medium is Fuji Crystal Archive, that has the best longevity
rating of any color photographic paper. Crystal Archive has an estimated
longevity rating of 60 years, whereas the best previous photographic
paper, Cibachrome/Ilfochrome, had a longevity rating of 35 years. The
sharpness and color is excellent, with very deep blacks. Crystal Archive
comes in three varieties, Semi-Gloss, Glossy, and Super Glossy. The
glossy papers look more deep and &ldquo;three-dimensional&rdquo;, however they are
also more fragile. The surface is less tolerant to scratches and
fingerprints than the semi-glossy paper. Super Glossy is a
polyester-based surface like Ilfochrome/Cibachrome which has a metallic,
mirror-like finish. It is also possible to print on
Ilfochrome/Cibachrome, but this is rarely done.</p>

<p>Printers include the <a href="http://www.cymbolic.com/products/lightjet5000.html">Cymbolic Sciences
Lightjet</a>, <a href="http://www.digital-photo-lab.com/Lambda.html">Durst
Lambda</a>, and <a href="http://www.zbe.com/products/chromira/chromira30.html">ZBE
Chromira</a>. Since
its introduction, in 1996, the Lightjet has emerged as the printer of
choice for fine-art printing. The Lambda is more often used for
commercial printing. I was told by a tech at a Custom Color Lab in Palo
Alto (incidently, the rise of digital forced that lab out of business in
2002) that the reason why the Lightjet is used for fine art printing is
that it is such a &ldquo;bear&rdquo; that it would be too inefficient for commercial
printing. We did a series of tests with one of my images that I had
printed on the Lightjet by another lab. With the settings that he used,
his Lambda prints were noticeably softer. Both of those printers use
lasers, and cost about \$200,000. The more recent Chromira uses LEDs,
and costs &ldquo;only&rdquo; around \$60,000. This made it possible for fine-art
labs such as West Coast Imaging or LaserLight to acquire one, whereas
before they would send out for Lightjets. The LEDs are low-power, unlike
lasers, which makes maintainance and calibration easier. The Chromira is
said to produce prints at least as good as the Lightjet. Because of
those high costs, those printers are exclusively operated by labs. There
are probably less than a thousand Lightjets installed worldwide.</p>

<p>The maximum printing size of the most commonly installed Lightjet
printers is 48x96 inches (Reed Photo Imaging of Denver can print up to
48x120 inches). The less common Lightjet 500XL (in the US: Laumont,
ColorEdge, Duggal, Ferrari Color, in Germany: Grieger) is currently the
largest continuous tone printer. It prints up to 72x120 inches. Lambda&rsquo;s
are limited to 50 inch wide. Earlier Chromiras were limited to 30 inch
wide. The newest generation can print up to 50 inch wide.</p>

<p>Because those printers have very high-quality interpolation algorithms,
and because of the nature of photographic paper, where there is a bit of
diffusion, excellent results can be obtained with 200DPI files, although
the native resolution is 300DPI.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the lab provides you with the ICC profiles of their
printer on each type of medium they use, since this is the only way
you&rsquo;d get a precisely matched color. A good lab also linearizes their
printer daily in order to provide consistent results.</p>

<p>The costs of materials for those printers is the lowest of any, at
around \$0.30 per square foot. However, labs have to recoup the price of
the initial investment for the printer. Competitive good labs charge
around \$12 per square foot.</p>

<h3 id="inkjet-printers-iris-epson-hp">Inkjet printers: Iris, Epson, HP</h3>

<p>Inkjet printers lay very fine droplets of ink on paper. High-end Inkjet
printers are a world apart from cheap office printers, and can produce
prints of remarkable quality. However, the technology is still maturing.
Colors are formed by the juxtaposition of droplets of a number of
primary colors.</p>

<p>A large variety of papers can be used. Some of those papers try to mimic
the apparency of traditional photographic papers, with RC surfaces,
semi-glossy and glossy finish, while others have a matte finish which is
unique to the inkjet process. Interesting heavy and thick fine-art matte
paper of refined appearance, as well as watercolor and canvas can be
used with the inkjets. With such papers, the print will look very
different from a traditional photograph. This look can be a bit &ldquo;flat&rdquo;
for an unframed print. Longevity rating is excellent, exceeding those of
photographic paper based on accelerated fading tests. It must be noted
that those tests failed to predict rapid fading of some ink/paper
combinations in the past.</p>

<h4 id="iris-printers">Iris printers</h4>

<p>The first inkjet printers to produce high-quality output were the Iris
printers. The Iris is a large drum based inkjet printer of high
mechanical complexity. It squirts a million droplets of ink from each of
its four nozzles (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) every second towards
a drum rotating at a speed of 150 inches per second. These droplets are
given an electric charge on their way to the drum either positive or
neutral to allow the printer to determine which should actually hit the
drum, and which should be deflected away to the waste system. Papers are
typically fine watercolor papers or canvas. The term Giclee (a French
word meaning &ldquo;to spray&rdquo;, although in slang the verb &ldquo;gicler&rdquo; has a
different meaning) was coined in the English-speaking world to refer to
Iris prints. It is nowadays often used to refer to any inkjet print on
fine art papers. There are two main limitations of Iris printers. The
first one is the cost, due to the high complexity of the printer,
limiting their use to labs. The second one is that the print has a size
limited by the size of the drum. Iris prints are often reproduction of
art pieces other than photography. For photographic art, the Iris
printers have largely been displaced by the Epson large format printers.</p>

<h4 id="epson-ultrachrome">Epson Ultrachrome</h4>

<p>Epson has dominated the market of fine-art printing since the
introduction of the Ultrachrome-based 7600/9600/10600 printers in 2002.
The 9600 costs \$5000 and prints to 44 inches wide. The 7600 costs
\$3000 and prints to 24 inches wide. Because the price difference is not
that large, and because the paper for the 9600 is more economical, I
would think that the 9600 would be a better choice, since you never know
how large you&rsquo;d like to print. The 10600 is a more efficient version of
the 9600 meant for production environments. Subsequently Epson released
the 4000, which prints up to 17 inches wide and was designed to be used
with cut sheets (while the other printers primarily use paper in roll).
The small brother of the family, the 2200 (13 inch wide) does not have
the self-calibration feature (see below), and is more prone to clogging
and other problems than the larger, professionally-oriented printers.</p>

<p>Those printers were the first large format inkjet printers yielding a
combination of quality color, metamerism problems well controlled, and
longevity (at least as good as the Crystal Archive papers), thanks to
their &ldquo;Ultrachrome&rdquo; pigmented inks. Before that, you had the choice
between dye-based inks that yielded excellent color and dense blacks,
but were not archival (some of the prints began to fade just after a few
years), and pigment-based inks that were archival, but had a reduced
color gamut (range of colors that can be reproduced), in particular in
the reds colors, and serious metamerism. Metamerism refers to the fact
that colors would shift when viewed under different light conditions. So
you could produce a print that was perfect looking in your studio under
5000K lighting, but if the print was viewed under more common tungsten
or halogen lights, it would take an ugly magenta cast.</p>

<p>The gamut (range of colors that can be reproduced accurately) is
slightly wider than the gamut of the Lightjet, in particular in the
blues and oranges. However, the blacks are not as deep as those obtained
on the Lightjet, which makes for prints that look more &ldquo;flat&rdquo;. The Epson
papers are not as nice to the touch as photographic papers. They are
also more easily damaged, for instance a water drop could damage a
print. However, once the print is framed, most of the advantages of the
Lightjet are reduced.</p>

<p>Many people avoid printing on glossy paper (such as Epson Premium Glossy
Photo Paper) with the Epson Ultrachrome inks, because of a problem known
as &ldquo;bronzing&rdquo;, or &ldquo;gloss differential&rdquo;. Gloss differential is what
happens when light is directly reflected towards the viewer from off of
the print. The result is darkened, or &ldquo;bronzed,&rdquo; reflections where ink
has been laid, and full reflection (blown-out highlights) where little
to no ink has been laid. Because different colors can have different
&ldquo;gloss&rdquo;, under certain viewing conditions (generally at an angle), the
print will not look uniform, but rather will have a patchy appearance.
In general, bronzing is not a real issue once the print is framed.
Semi-glossy papers (such as Epson Premium Luster Photo Paper) can
exhibit this problem to a lesser degree. Matte papers do not suffer from
bronzing. Bronzing can be mitigated by applying a coating to the print
with such products as Lyson Print Guard, and Premier Art Print Shield,
that make the reflection more uniform.</p>

<p>Another potential problem is &ldquo;out-gassing&rdquo; with glossy and semi-glossy
papers. In order to avoid nozzle clogging, some humectant chemicals that
are very slowly evaporating are added to the inks. When printing on
photographic-like papers (glossy and semi-glossy coated surfaces), those
chemicals are not absorbed by the paper. They&rsquo;ll still be on the print
long after the water has gone and the print &ldquo;feels&rdquo; dry. As they
evaporate over time, they can cause fogging in the inside of the glass
when the print is framed. With uncoated paper, this is not a problem,
since the humectants can be absorbed by the paper. In order to prevent
outgassing, one must cure all the prints for a few days before framing.
The best way to do it is, after letting the print dry for about a hour,
is to lay absorbent paper (Chris Jordan uses news print paper that comes
in huge rolls of a thousand feet long for \$50, while Joseph Holmes uses
Light Impressions Renaissance non-buffered archival paper) totally flat
against the print with no air in-between for at least 24 hours,
preferably with pressure. Prints can be stacked and interleaved with
absorbent paper in order to achieve that. The paper acts like a sponge
and draws out the gases from the inks much faster than they would escape
if just exposed to air. The paper will go wavy as the solvent
evaporates. You keep interleaving until the paper is no longer wavy.</p>

<p>Setting up the 7600/9600/10600 can be tricky. In order to get the widest
color gamut from the 7600/9600/10600, it is necessary to use the &ldquo;no
color adjustment setting&rdquo;, and profile the printer. Creating a good
profile can be very difficult, since the grey-scale raw output in that
setting is highly non-linear and suffers from complex color casts.
Fortunately, the 7600/9600/10600 incorporates an automatic closed-loop
calibration technology which is so good that any two printers provide
basically the exact same output. It is therefore possible to use a
profile created by someone else for their printer on your printer. Bill
Atkinson created excellent profiles for his own use, and makes them
available for free.</p>

<p>The native resolution of the Epson printers is 360DPI. When using a file
with not enough pixels, it is in general better to interpolate the file
in photoshop. Feeding the Epson with less than 240DPI results in
inferior prints on photographic paper. However, I have once produced a
large print on canvas at 175DPI and have been pleasantly surprised at
the results.</p>

<h4 id="hewlett-packard">Hewlett-Packard</h4>

<p>Hewlett Packard large-format printers have a wide installed base in
engineering and design studios. Recently HP began to target the fine-art
market.</p>

<p>In 2004, HP released a new set of inks and matching paper, which is a
&ldquo;swellable medium&rdquo; that expends to receive the inks, and then contracts
to protect them. They are available in the affordable (\$1300) Designjet
130 printer, that can print up to 24 inch. This made it possible for
them to use dye-based inks while achieving a longevity rating comparable
to Epson pigmented inks.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Designjet 130 prints compares very favorably with
the Epson prints. In particular, Charles Cramer (View Camera Magazine,
March/April 2005) observed that the blacks obtained by the 130 were the
blackest that he has ever seen in his career, better than the highly
regarded color Dye Transfers, or even Selenium-toned Ilford FB B&amp;W
silver gelatin papers. He rates the density of the blacks in the
following order, starting from the best blacks: HP Designjet 130, FB B&amp;W
silver gelatin, Dye transfer, Lightjet, Ilfochrome, Epson 9600. This
observation has been corroborated by several reviewers.</p>

<h4 id="epson-ultrachrome-k3">Epson Ultrachrome K3</h4>

<p>In May 2005, Epson a announced new line of printers with new inks,
called Ultrachrome K3. The line consists of the 2400 (replaces the
2200), 4800 (replaces the 4000), 7800 (replaces 7600), and 9800
(replaces 9600). The 2400 and 4800 shipped in the spring of 2005, while
the others are scheduled for fall 2005.</p>

<p>According to Joseph Holmes <a href="http://www.josephholmes.com/news.html">beta-testing
report</a>, this printer represents
a significant advance. The differential gloss problem (&ldquo;bronzing&rdquo;) is
much reduced, the output much more neutral and linear, and the blacks
considerably improved, in particular on glossy papers. They would fall
in between Dye transfer and Lightjet. The Ultrachrome K3 inks have a
slightly larger gammut, and an even better longevity rating than the
Ultrachrome inks. They are also said to produce outstanding black and
white prints.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Continuous tone printers produce prints that are traditional photographs
(silver-based). If you like the brilliance of a glossy print, they are
currently unsurpassed, especially with polyester-based surfaces. The
main drawback is the necessity to use a lab, at a cost of more than
\$12/square foot.</p>

<p>Inkjet printers have dramatically improved. In many metrics, they have
surpassed continuous tone printers. They can create prints that have a
similar look as traditional photographs as well as prints that have a
unique look on matte, fine art, and canvas surfaces. However, the prints
still look more like ink on paper (because it is what they are) than
traditional photographs, where the color is embodied in the paper,
giving it a more three-dimensional and glowing appearance.</p>

<p>The printing costs (ink and paper) vary between \$1 and \$2 per square
foot. See the tables for <a href="http://www.inkjetart.com/pro/7600_9600/cost_page.html">Epson Ultrachrome
printers</a> (the
cost and printing costs for the next-generation Epson printers <sup>9800</sup>&frasl;<sub>7800</sub>
are expected to be the same) and <a href="http://h41186.www4.hp.com/Data/costperprint/">HP
printers</a>.</p>

<p>This, combined with the relatively affordable costs of the printers, is
the main advantage of inkjet printers. They allow the photographer to
own his printer. Having in-house printing capabilities, besides
improving efficiency, let you have instant and low cost feedback, and
fine-tune prints in a way that would not be practical when you have to
order prints from a lab. The cost of consumables is much less than the
cost of ordering a print from a lab, which in the long run makes the
printer pay for itself if you print enough.</p>
