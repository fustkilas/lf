<h1>Loading Sheet Film</h1>


<h3><a href="jdbeyer@exit109.com">Jean-David Beyer</a></h3>






<p>First of all, there are 3 half-boxes nested together. Sort-of like this:</p>

<pre><code>        __________________________
        |                        |
        | ______________________ |
        |||                    |||
        |||                    |||
        |||                    |||
        |||                    |||
         |                      |
         ------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>This is to provide a mystery maze to make it hard for the dark to leak out of the box when it is exposed to normal room light.</p>

<p>If you hold a sheet of film with the notches along the top edge and in the upper right corner, the emulsion is facing you. The notches will be along the 4&rdquo; side. Thus, it will look a little like this (but since it is dark, you will not see it) when the emulsion is facing you:</p>

<pre><code>        _________________ _ _ ____
        |                V V V   |
        |                        |
</code></pre>

<p>Most people load the film so that the non-notched edge of the film goes in the holder first. I do this. There is no reason for it, it is just my policy.</p>

<p>Inside the box are 4 aluminized mylar (or something) envelopes that may be light-tight, but Kodak warn that this may not be so. I  always assume they are not light tight. They are there to protect the film from humidity and harmful gasses. If you buy a 25-sheet box (costs more per sheet that way), there will be but one envelope. For Kodak color film, the boxes have 50 sheets or 10 sheets.</p>

<p>There used to be an instruction sheet in each box in several languages.  I did not find one in my latest box of TMY 5053. Maybe this is no longer provided for my language education, but do not be surprised if you find one.</p>

<p>These envelopes are too tough for me to tear open with my fingers without the risk of bending the film or exposing it to excess pressure, so I cut one end or one edge off with scissors.</p>

<p>Inside each envelope are 25 sheets of film, all aligned the same way. They are sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard for protection (i.e., there are 27 things in each envelope). I pull the entire ensemble from the envelope; I do not try to remove individual sheets as I fear fingermarks and scratches.</p>

<p>I load my filmholders on the baseboard of my enlarger. I put the empty holders at the back left of the baseboard, the box of film on the front left. After the lights are off, I open the box and place the two tops to the left of the baseboard. I then open the top  envelope and take out the two cardboards with the film between them and place the now empty envelope in one of the box tops (so I can find it later) and place the films crosswise (so they will not fall in) in the film box. As I do this, I check the notches so they are at the top-right (i.e., face up). There is an argument for doing it face down (dust is supposedly less likely to fall on the film).  I then put the top cardboard in the other box top.  When done, since I have never loaded all 100 sheets, or seldom even 25 sheets at once, I put the cardboard back on top of the pile of film, put the film back in the envelope, and close up the boxen again.</p>

<p>The white side of the holder means unexposed. The dark side means empty or exposed.  The white side has bumps or lumps so you can  identify it in the dark.</p>

<p>I suggest vacuum cleaning the holders (in a separate room if possible) before loading them. I suggest vacuum cleaning the loading area the day before loading (you can do it immediately before if you have a central vacuum system).</p>

<p>If you can get some junk sheet film cheap (expired from a dealer, or from a friend), I suggest trying some loading with the lights on first, for practice. The procedure is not that difficult once you have done it once or twice.</p>
