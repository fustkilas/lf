<p>Generating classic glass negative look when scanning 4x5</p>

<p>I recently was looking for a cheap way to scan my B&amp;W negatives into the
computer, mainly to verify if the composition was really good and the
neg worth spending time on in the darkroom. I searched for 2nd hand
scanners but best I could do was a Umax for 300 euro (=dollar), which
was out of my budget. I then ran into a guy who said he used an
ordinairy flatbed scanner and put a halogen building lamp with
milk-glass above it. The scan&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t great but good enough for
analyzing. I used the same technique but rather than using milkglass I
covered the lamp with a piece of white printerpaper to make it more
flexible.</p>

<p>Recently however I decided to put the paper on top of the negative, as
it was sunday and I ran out of printing paper accidently, and usally the
paper gets wrinkeled when I put it around the lamp. The result was
stunning. Together with some dirt on the scanners glass plate (caused by
dried moisture) and sepia toning it resulted in the scan that closely
resembled old glass negatives, much better than any PS old-style looks.</p>
