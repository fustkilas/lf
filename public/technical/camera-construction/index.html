<p>As my interest in photography and large format in particular has
evolved, I have become aware of several things about the hobby in
general that have led me down the path of simplified large format camera
design. My initial interest was aroused by the incredible detail that is
visible in the photographs taken by many of the pioneering photographers
from earlier eras. After a number of years of casual observation I
decided to see what design features these earlier cameras had in common
with there modern counterparts and began to collect available examples
of various types such as the folding view, tailboard, box and early
large roll cameras.</p>

<p>The first thing that became apparent was the high price of collecting
usable samples and secondly the rather advanced stage of deterioration
that was common to the frames and bellows of these cameras. I then began
a quest for information on early fabrication and manufacturing
techniques. The information that I found consisted almost entirely of
repairing them and very little about design or building them so I began
to develop my own methods of construction based on readily available
materials and low tech tooling that most craftsman are likely to have
available to them or own personally.</p>

<p>The bellows being the most commonly dilapidated item I concentrated my
efforts in this direction first. All techniques for fabrication that I
could locate involved the rather imprecise method of adhering the ribs
or stiffeners directly to the pre-cut covering with little or no method
of precise control of intersecting dimensions or angles. After
dissecting various models, I developed the method of temporarily
adhering the stiffeners to a precise layout and then transferring them
to a precision matching form wrapped in the base or inside layer of the
covering. After application of the outside layer of the covering the
bellows is then slipped off of the form and the end rings are fixed in
place. With this simple method I was able to design and complete a
bellows with no error in very little time.</p>

<p>I next focused my efforts on the camera back and immediately became
aware of the diversity of the existing designs and the differing
setbacks to the film plane of the various film and plate holders of
these early cameras. These designs seemed to consolidate to somewhat of
a standard in later years but when measuring them I observed noticeable
differences from the face of the film holder to the film plane that in
some cases would most likely be covered by the lens depth of field but
in others the difference such a divergence from the norm that I began to
wonder if it was intentional. After studying the setback of the ground
glass on various cameras I found it to be true that manufacturers of the
time did produce film holders and camera backs that were compatible only
with there own equipment and were not the least interchangeable as far
as focus but to the casual observer the mechanical fit was perfect. I
can&rsquo;t help but wonder how many countless hours were spent by early
technicians in there darkrooms trying in vain to figure out where thy
went wrong!</p>

<p>The design feature that seemed to exist on all these backs was the
rather heavy spring pressures that resulted as the film or plate holder
was inserted after focusing was achieved and the difficulty encountered
when removing the film holder after the shot was taken. To say it is a
two handed operation is perhaps putting it to mildly in my opinion!</p>

<p>Keeping these observations in mind I decided to design a back that could
interchangeably accommodate various film or plate holders and
incorporate matching ground glass setbacks for whatever brand or type
the user would be inclined to experiment with. The solution I developed
to work around these problems was to create a focusing glass that is
removed before the film holder is inserted. If the side rails that
support the ground glass are fabricated to match the film or plate
holder focal plane setback and are machined to the same thickness as the
sides of the film holder that is utilized, an exact focal distance match
can be obtained and the film holder can be inserted and removed quite
easily without disturbing the position of the camera.</p>

<p>For the frame of the camera I decided to utilize all friction stop
adjustment to remove the stumbling block, for the average experimenter,
of successfully fabricating a geared drive actuating mechanism while
still incorporating all movements required for focusing or offsets. The
method of fabrication I devised utilizes commonly available aluminum
channel and standard dimension hardwood that can be purchased from the
local home supply store and needs only to be cut to the proper length
before construction can begin.</p>

<p>I believe that my design will allow the casual experimenter to enter the
world of large format photography at a time when its utilization is
becoming completely overshadowed by high priced products a rapid drift
toward digital media as the only low cost option with pleasing results.
The availability of low cost salvageable components such as lenses, film
holders and complete darkroom systems has never been higher and not
allowing these fine items to go waste when they can be easily obtained
and utilized in the extension of an extremely valuable and satisfying
art form is my reasoning for developing this low cost, simple, yet
precise method of camera chassis construction.</p>
