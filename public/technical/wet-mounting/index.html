<h2 id="wet-mounting-prints">Wet mounting prints</h2>

<p><em>Summary: This is a description of the technique my studio used to
wet-mount large black-and-white murals around 1960. While some of the
materials have changed, I believe the basic technique remains valid.</em></p>

<p>Just a word about the prints. We used Kodak Mural R paper in rolls about
40&rdquo; wide. While this paper is no longer made, something very similar may
be available from Luminos in NYC: <a href="http://www.luminos.com">http://www.luminos.com</a></p>

<p>The value of this paper was that its base was entirely cotton fiber,
with no wood pulp. When it got wet it went totally limp, like a wet
bedsheet. You could not ding, crack nor crease the surface, making it
foolproof to handle. And it could be folded and unfolded to be developed
in a small deep tray, like a restaurant bus-pan. We also had large
home-made wooden forms, lined with plastic painter&rsquo;s drop-cloths.</p>

<p>Development was &ldquo;to completion&rdquo;, about 5 minutes in Dektol, to allow for
even development in spite of the delay in wetting parts of the print
while unfolding. We didn&rsquo;t use an easel for exposing such a large print.
The paper was pinned, with upholsterer&rsquo;s T-pins, to a sheet of Homasote
which we obtained from a lumberyard.</p>

<p>Drying and mounting fiber-based black-and-white photographic prints has
always been difficult. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to get a large fiber print
to dry completely flat. Large dry-mount presses cost several thousand
dollars. And applying pressure to wavy prints often causes permanent
damage from wrinkles and creases.</p>

<p>One solution is to mount the print with glue while still damp and soft.
This technique has the added advantage that the print can be
repositioned and slid-around indefinitely.</p>

<p>Our technique for the murals mentioned above, involved coating <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo;
double-tempered Masonite (smooth both sides) with Elmer&rsquo;s white glue.
Today, I would recommend substituting Gatorfoam&reg; (not Fom-Cor&reg;) as
it is much lighter than Masonite and completely waterproof. Fom-Cor&reg;
is much too soft and will dent and bend.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t find a local source for Gatorfoam&reg;, contact Modern
Plastics at: <a href="http://modernplastics.com">http://modernplastics.com</a> It is made in 4&rsquo;x8&rsquo; sheets, up to
an inch thick, in white, black or natural. You can easily cut it with a
crosscut or plywood blade on a table saw. They will also cut it to size
for you. I believe Light Impressions:
<a href="http://www.lightimpressionsdirect.com/servlet/OnlineShopping">http://www.lightimpressionsdirect.com/servlet/OnlineShopping</a> also has it
in a few standard sizes.</p>

<p>If you cut your own board, dust it very, very carefully with a tack-rag.
The tiny particles of white sawdust are nearly invisible, but will cause
a noticable &ldquo;pimple&rdquo; in the mounted print if you miss one.</p>

<p>We bought the Elmer&rsquo;s glue in gallon jugs and diluted it very slightly
with water, no more than 1&rdquo; of water in the jug. The glue was then
heavily applied to the Masonite with a paint roller and allowed to dry
completely. After dry, some of the higher peaks left by the roller
texture were lightly sanded off. Don&rsquo;t go crazy here - the more glue on
the board the better.</p>

<p>We would then pull the mural prints from the wash, dripping, sopping wet
and lay them over the Masonite. (It helps if you have on staff a
bullfighter who&rsquo;s good with cape-work.) The prints were always larger,
by at least three inches per side than the board. Paper stretches (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;
per yard) when wet and shrinks back somewhat as it dries. You need a
large slop factor for this method. A 40&rdquo; print will never match a 40&rdquo;
board. And then there were the shadows left by those T-pins on the
print.</p>

<p>Working from the center outward, squeegee the water off the print. We
worked over a concrete floor in an old factory building. You may need
plastic drop-cloths. The water will re-wet and re-activate the dry
Elmer&rsquo;s glue and make the print adhere to the board. The print will
shrink as it dries, pulling out any small bubbles or wrinkles.</p>

<p>We sometimes used to carefully glue and wrap the excess print paper
around the edges of the Masonite and stick it to the back of the board.
This gave a nice clean look to prints which were not to be framed.
Otherwise, we would trim the print to the edge of the board with a
single-edge razor blade. To keep the Masonite from bowing due to the
shrinking print, we sometimes glued another wet blank print to the back
to pull against it.</p>

<p>Then allow to dry overnight, flat on the floor with the print side up.
No pressure necessary.</p>

<p>After everything was completely dry, we could varnish (now use
water-based product for non-amber clarity) the print to make it
washable.</p>

<p>I believe this technique can be used with modern photo paper as well.
Not sure about trying to wrap stiff double-weight paper around the
board. And a semi-matte or matte surface (Luminos &ldquo;Charcoal&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Tapestry&rdquo;) would be closer to the old mural paper. Photo linen from
Luminos would also be excellent, albeit expensive.</p>

<p>I would also try drying a print with a squeegee and sponge until just
damp and then applying it with fresh wet glue as in wallpapering.
Cellulose wallpaper paste might be substituted for Elmer&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>PVA is the generic chemical name for this type of adhesive, which is
also available in an archival variety, the claim-to-fame of which is
that it is supposed to remain flexible and not turn brittle. However, I
have a print from 35 years ago glued with Elmer&rsquo;s which is still just
fine.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s how we used to mount prints without a monster press when
JFK and Jackie were still running Camelot.</p>
