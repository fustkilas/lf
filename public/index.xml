&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those close-ups were extracted from the image below. Each of them contains enough detail to make a sharp photograph on its own. Click on them to view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;autumn-reflections.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;autumn-reflections.small.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;300&amp;rdquo;
height=&amp;ldquo;214&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]{#lf}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For landscapes, I prefer &lt;a href=&#34;../canham/canham.html&#34;&gt;this large format (LF)
camera&lt;/a&gt;, because it produces an image which
matches my perception of a visually rich world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because the size of the film is 5x7 inches (12.7cm x 17.8cm), the
camera records an amazing amount of detail, 25 times what is contained
in a regular 135 (24mm x 36mm) frame. Everything which I saw is on the
film, and even more. When I examine my transparencies under a lupe, I
notice from time to time details which escaped me when I was looking at
the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that what I display here does not even capture the full detail in
the original transparency, but only a quarter of it: the scanning was
done only at a resolution necessary to produce a 24x30 inches (60 x 75
cm) print, which is 6000 x 9000 pixels. However, the transparency has a
resolution of at least 50 lpm, is 5x7 inches (12.7cm x 17.8cm) and
therefore could have been used to produce a quality digital image file
at least four times larger (12000 x 17000 pixels). Such a file would
have been close to 1 Gigabye. At the resolution used, there is
absolutely no fuzziness and no grain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the LF camera is not rigid because the lens is connected to the
film plane with a bellows. This let me control the perspective and the
distribution of sharpness in a way which cannot be achieved with a
regular camera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember the trees as beeing parallel to each other. The LF camera
renders them that way. However the camera is looking down since the
lake fills up more than two-thirds of the frame. With a regular
camera, this would cause the trees in the background to lean towards
the edge of the frame, which would not be quite right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember each part of the scene with the same clarity. The LF
camera looks at the close objects sharply and looks at the horizon
sharply at the same time: notice that the grass in the foreground,
only a few feet in front of the camera, is seen as clearly as the
distant trees. In contrast, a regular camera has to focus either
close or far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this particular photograph, those adjustments were quite simple and
intuitive. It was getting dark fast. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make the
photograph in full daylight, because I knew that the colors would be
lost to the contrast, and instead I chose to wait for the quiet and soft
light of dusk. After leveling the camera, I lowered the lens using front
fall to obtain the composition I wanted. I then tilted the lens, which
tilts the plane of sharp focus, until it became horizontal. I was lucky
that day because the air was quite still, so even in the 15 second
exposure (necessitated by the f 22 aperture and the slow speed of Fuji
Velvia), there was only minimal blurring of the grasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;More large format landscapes&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;../&#34;&gt;More about technical aspects of
large format photography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article discusses what you need to start large format photography:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lens(es)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;film holders and film&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tripod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessories: darkcloth, focussing lupe, cable release, meter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of kit, see &lt;a href=&#34;camera-bag/&#34;&gt;inside my camera bag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-camera&#34;&gt;The camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think first about your intended application. 35mm cameras are universal, MF cameras and LF cameras are really more specialized. What kind of work are you going to do, and in which conditions ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-format-to-use&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which format to use ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roll-film&lt;/strong&gt; Shooting roll-film with a view camera is an interesting combination. There are cameras and backs which let you shoot 6x7, 6x9, 6x12, 6x17. Compared to 4x5, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with sheet film, the cost is very low (lower than for 35mm actually, if the surface is considered), and there is a very wide choice of film. If you chose a 2x3 view camera, it can be actually cheaper than a lot of MF systems, and might not be heavier, especially if you buy lenses with small coverage. However, compared to convenentional MF systems, you gain &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; camera movements (their effect is not always very easy to judge on the small image area) and you loose a lot of ease of use (this might be a plus for folks willing to &amp;ldquo;slow down&amp;rdquo;). Another option that I find more interesting is to use a &lt;a href=&#34;#roll-film&#34;&gt;roll-film back&lt;/a&gt; with a 4x5 camera. There are 4x5 lightweight cameras wich are not much more heavy than 2x3 cameras. Then you can have the option of doing 4x5 if the opportunity looks very good. Speaking from my own experience and that of other folks, when you come home the 2x3 images will look a bit small if you have shot 4x5, and you will probably think that given the burden of carrying and operating a view camera, you&amp;rsquo;d rather have the big image. If you use a panoramic format like 6x12, this comparison might not apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4x5&lt;/strong&gt; This is in practice the smaller format where you can use sheet film (2x3 sheet film exists but is marginal). It is by far the most popular format, with lots of cameras, lenses (from 45mm to as long as the bellows will accomodate), film, different type of holders (including roll-film, polaroid, preloaded). For most people that&amp;rsquo;s the format of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5x7&lt;/strong&gt; The equipment is not really heavier than for 4x5: the lenses are most of the time the same, there are 6lbs cameras. It is mostly the holders which are bigger: they produce an image which is almost two times as large, but is more rectangular, in a format homothetic to 35mm and 6x9. It is large enough to produce decent contacts. but still small enough that it is relatively easy to enlarge. The only significant drawback comes from the scarcity of the film (as of summer 96, the only slide film available in the USA are Kodak EPP and EPR. Euro or Japaneese photographers have Fuji emulsions). One thing that I am really missing is the possibility to use Polaroid film, and quickloads. Processing and printing is more difficult to obtain with labs, and if you want a new color enlarger, you might have to buy a 8x10 enlarger. However, all these problems do not affect b&amp;amp;w photographers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8x10 and larger&lt;/strong&gt; These formats gives you beautiful contact prints. Contact printing is required for some alternative process (like Platinium). The marginal quality over 4x5 or 5x7 obtained in enlargements is probably noticeable only for the extreme enlargements. The drawback is the size and weight of the equipment, as well as its cost. Older 8x10 cameras can be have for (relatively) cheap, and a Philips camera is not much heavier than some 4x5 cameras. However larger formats (sometimes called Ultra LF) require a considerable amount of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-features-to-look-for-in-a-camera&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What features to look for in a camera ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to consider. There are more discussions about the various trade-offs (wood vs metal, monorail vs flatbed, etc&amp;hellip;) elsewhere on the &lt;a href=&#34;./&#34;&gt;LF page&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that YOU have to find out what your priorities are first, and that not every camera, no matter how highly praised, is for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portable enough.&lt;/strong&gt; Whereas all the folding cameras are portable and have a reasonnable weight (3lbs - 7 lbs), some monorails are too heavy and bulky to be used in the field. There is a tradeoff here between portability and and versatility (possibility to use many focals and movements), and also rigidity. Usually, for the same features, a wooden camera will be lighter, but often less compact than an equivalent metal field camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow you to use your focals of choice&lt;/strong&gt; All the cameras do what they are designed for with a normal lens. However, with shorter and longer lenses difficulties might arise:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short focals&lt;/strong&gt;. Some flatbed cameras have very limited wide-angle abilities, due to:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large minimum extension,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed bellows (the bellows compression will make movements impossible unless you have a wide-angle bellows which is shorter and more flexible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;beds showing in the field of viewA recessed lensboard can make up for some problems by allowing a larger lens to film distance than the focal length of your lens. However, they are expensive ($150) and the controls of the lens become hard to reach. A monorail is usually more flexible, since all of them have a small minimum extension, wide-angle bellows. Depending on the nature of the tripod mount attachment, the rail showing in the field of view might or might not be a problem, but there are sometimes optional short rails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long focals&lt;/strong&gt;. A camera with bellows which are too short will not allow you to use long lenses, or to do close-ups. The cure for this problem are very limited. You can use on some cameras a combinations of front tilts, or get an extension board (opposite of a recessed board), but this will give you only a few additional centimeters. Here, again monorails are more flexible, since you can usually purchase a longer rail and extension bellows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enough movements for your type of photography.&lt;/strong&gt; The monorails have all the movements, whereas some type of flat bed cameras have almost none. Studio photography usually requires a great deal of image control, architecture requires shifts to maintain correct perspective. Landscape require the less movements, although to obtain adequate depth of field due to the fact that longer focals are needed for a given field of view, some tilts are often necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rigidity and precision of alignment&lt;/strong&gt; This is all about sharpness. To shoot in windy conditions you need a camera which is rigid enough so that the standards won&amp;rsquo;t move (resulting in unsharp pictures). The locks have to be strong enough so that the standards don&amp;rsquo;t move when you insert the holder. Misalignements between standards or within the back standard to the film plane might cause misfocus in some areas of the image (although this is critical for reproduction work, I doubt that for real shooting it matters). Generally speaking, the metal cameras are more rigid and precisely aligned than the wooden cameras. The lighweight cameras are more likely to have problems here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of operation.&lt;/strong&gt; Geared controls, positive and well placed locks, spirit levels, various scales, zero detents, smooth operation, rear focussing (very important for macro work), etc.., all help. If complicated adjustments are used, a &lt;a href=&#34;yaw.html&#34;&gt;yaw-free&lt;/a&gt; design might help. This feature is not relevant otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-is-best-wood-or-metal&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which is best, wood, or metal ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of wood (besides being cheaper to work) is that it is lighter. A consequence is that for the same weight you can make a bigger camera, which in turn will provide you more movements and more extension. A typical example are the Wisner and Canhams which are quite bulky (for 4x5 cameras) but offer more movements and bellows than any other field cameras. A metal camera using the same design would weight more than 11 lbs. Wood is also much better at dampening high-frequency vibration than any metal or metal alloy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metal has technically many advantages. It is more rigid, which result in less flexing and low frequency vibrations. This is good for long extensions. It is more solid, resulting in a more durable camera. If your tripod is knocked over by the wind, a metal camera is quite likely to remain functional with a few scratches, whereas a wooden camera could be totally destroyed. My reversible wooden back broke at the edge, which would have been unlikely to happy with metal. The stability with respect to environmental conditions like humidity and temperature is also better (one day my Canham would focus quite smoothly, one day it would be quite sticky). Last, it is easier to implement small features on metal. Therefore metal cameras tend generally to be more compact, and to offer greater accessory systems like reflex hoods, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-cameras-to-consider-to-get-started-on-a-budget&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which cameras to consider to get started on a budget?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is best to buy used equipment. Shutterbug (dealers advertisements, classified, swap announces) and the net are good sources. Some recommended used stores with knowledgeable and honest people are Midwest Photo Exchange and Lens and Repro. There is not much which can go wrong on a large format camera which has not been seriously abused, since there are no delicate small high precision parts or electronics. Older cameras are well usable, but usually lack the convenience of more modern designs. Some of them are so beat-up that they lost their original rigidity. Another thing to watch for is pinholes in the bellows. A new bellows can always be installed, but the price might be a significant fraction of that of the cheaper cameras. Here are some suggestions (refer to the reviews for more details):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheapest.&lt;/strong&gt; A Speed or Crown Graphic press camera (at the expense of movements, not a good choice if you are interested in perspective control or depth of field control. A basic monorail like Calumet CC-400, Omega, Graphic View II (at the expense of portability, at about 8 lbs., they are a little heavy and bulky for hiking), Bender (if you like woodworking). A Burke and James (good movements, more portable than a monorail, might be a bit ratty). $250.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap.&lt;/strong&gt; A new Calumet Cadet (a monorail camera). $400. Toyo 45cx. $450. A used lightweight wood-field (such as the Tachihara). $400-$500. A Technika III (metal, flatbed, adequate movements). $600.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still reasonable.&lt;/strong&gt; A new lightweight wood-field (around $700), a used Wista, a used Zone VI. The new Arca-Swiss discovery (maybe too recent to find used) and the Sinar A1 (monorail cameras).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-lenses&#34;&gt;The lenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-look-for-in-a-lens&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to look for in a lens ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focal.&lt;/strong&gt; You are probably familiar with 35mm. Pick up your favorite focals and find the equivalent LF focals either using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mat.uc.pt/~rps/photos/angles.html&#34;&gt;Rui Salgueiro&amp;rsquo;s field-of-view calculator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/philg/photo/lens-table.html&#34;&gt;Ed Scott&amp;rsquo; comparison tables&lt;/a&gt;. Note however that while 5x7 is homothetic to 35mm, 4x5 and 8x10 are both more squarish. More folks are happy with just one lens in the LF world than in 35mm. Personnally, I would tend to err on the wide side, since cropping is not too much of an issue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coverage.&lt;/strong&gt; A lens projects an image circle which must be large enough to cover the film area without vignetting. The absolute minimun which is required is the diagonal of the format. If some movements are used, the diameter of the image circle has to be larger to cover the film area. The larger this circle is, the more movements you can do. In particular, it is easy to calculate how must shift you can get knowing the image circle and the format. The image circle is usually expressed in a millimeter diameter, at infinity, and at a specific aperture of f/16 or f/22. Stopping down might increase its diameter. Focussing to closer distances always does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For general use, make sure to get enough to be able to do some movements, maybe around 180mm for 4x5 and around 230mm for 5x7. Applications like table top and architecture photography often require extensive movements and therefore larger image circles. Lenses with more coverage than you need will be heavy, big, and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum aperture.&lt;/strong&gt; You won&amp;rsquo;t use a LF lens wide open, however a large maximum aperture ( f/4.5 or f/5.6) makes viewing and focussing easier, especially if you are indoors or like to photograph in low light. However, for a given focal length, the faster lens will be larger, heavier and more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability.&lt;/strong&gt; Be careful here. Lenses of same focal lengths vary &lt;em&gt;considerably&lt;/em&gt; in size and weight ! Make sure to see the lens before buying. Generally speaking focal length, coverage, and speed contribute to a big lens, all other factors being equal. That&amp;rsquo;s where modern lenses don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily shine. A significant portion of the weight and bulk can be due to the shutter. Longer focal lengths and/or faster lenses often come with a big #3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optical quality.&lt;/strong&gt; Basically all the modern lenses (current models from Fuji,Nikon, Rodenstock, Schneider) are good enough, and very difficult to distinguish from each other at the apertures used in practice. For color work, it is generally recommended to stick to those, or to relatively recent multicoated lenses, although a single coated lens properly shaded might work fine. This is less critical for B&amp;amp;W. For details, see &lt;a href=&#34;lenses-general.html&#34;&gt;a general discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit.&lt;/strong&gt; Some big lenses cannot be used with some field cameras or with some lensboards. Also, make sure you have enough belows. When using long focal lengths you may consider choosing a telephoto design lens (usually designated with a &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo;) rather than a regular design lens of the same focal length. These lenses require approximatively &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of the bellows a regular lens would. However, they are usually more expensive, have less coverage, and behave a bit weird with respect to tilts. They are not necessarily more compact or lighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;film-and-holders&#34;&gt;Film and holders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conventional-vs-preloaded-film-quickload-readyload-polaroid&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conventional vs preloaded film (Quickload, Readyload, Polaroid)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either use film that you load yourself in cut-film holders or preloaded film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first case, you need a dark and relatively clean place to load your film holders (might be a problem when travelling), and to unload them. Dust might be a problem, you have to clean your holders carefully. You cannot have too many holders. With a large number of holders, not only you&amp;rsquo;ll be sure not to run out of film ready to shoot, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to reload less often, and you can keep exposed film in holders, which makes tracking easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readyloads are from Kodak, Quickloads from Fuji. The readyloads from Kodak hold two sheets of film, the Quickloads hold one. The film is in a paper packet that you put in a special holder (they are made by Kodak, Fuji, Polaroid). Polaroid film can be processed instantly or latter, inside the holder. The other films are processed normally in the lab. Here are the advantages of preloaded film:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to load and unload. Especially nice in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost dust-free. Because they&amp;rsquo;re factory loaded in a clean room, the only dust you get on the film is the dust that lands on it after you pull the envelope/darkslide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lighter/Less bulky. Preloaded film allows you to carry more ready-to-use film (although in the long run, if you are using lots of film, it will end up being heavier) since you don&amp;rsquo;t have the weight of individual film holders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to track after exposure. You can just write information on each packet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main disadvantages are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more expensive (a sheet of conventional Velvia 4x5 costs $1.7 vs $2.6 for preloaded)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only a limited number of emulsions are offered by Fuji (in particular no B&amp;amp;W film), Kodak, and Polaroid (the non-instant film is Fuji film).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kodak system is known to suffer from light leaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less sharp (maybe). In a Camera and Darkroom article, J.Englender writes that the preloaded system do not yield as sharp results as conventional holders due to film flatness problems (the best results are obtained with Graphmatics, then conventional holders, Fuji and Kodak holders, and Polaroid holders). Many people ignore that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you have a lot of film to carry on a long trip, the enveloppes end up adding up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best results for the preloaded films seems to be obtained using the dedicated holder (Fuji and Kodak), although the Fuji Quickload work OK with the Polaroid holder. The new 545i holder is significantly lighter than the old 545 which was all metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conventional-cut-film-holders&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conventional cut-film holders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide not to use the preloaded systems but instead buy your film in sheets and load it, you have the choice between regular film holders which hold one sheet on each side, and Grafmatics. Generally speaking, if you buy used holders, check them carefully for dust and light leaks problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wooden holders tend to slide better in wooden cameras, and are slightly lighter than plastic holders, but they cannot be found new. As far as new holders are concerned, most people use Fidelity or Lisco holders, which are the cheapest. Some brands make more expensive holders, but nobody has been able to prove that they yield sharper pictures in usual working conditions. The extremity of the dark slide is marked with two colors (black and white) and raised dots so that you can remember whether they contain blank film or exposed film. In addition, there is a tab which is supposed to keep the dark slide locked and prevent you from removing it accidentally, as well as help you identified loaded vs empty holders, but I have found that it tends to be quite unreliable. Riteway makes a holder with a button instead of the tab, which is an improvement, but it is not compatible with some cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;holders.html#grafmatics&#34;&gt;Grafmatics&lt;/a&gt; are more light and compact, and allow you to shoot in a sequence, but the loading is more difficult, esp. if you want to unload after using a holder only partially. They can be bought only used.&lt;a name=&#34;roll-film&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-roll-film-roll-film-backs-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;roll-film&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roll-film backs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;roll-film&#34;&gt;Roll film backs are available for all roll-film sizes to 6x12 the most common being 6x7 and 6x9. There are two types of roll-film holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graflock-type holders&lt;/strong&gt;: Some 4x5 cameras have a back (Graflock, this standard was introduced on the Graflex cameras) where you remove the ground-glass assembly and replace it with a roll-film back. There are plenty of brands to chose from: Graflex, Singer, Linhof (super-rollex), Mamiya RB, Horseman, some of which can be found for quite cheap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slide-in type holders&lt;/strong&gt;: These holders are flat because the film spools are at one end. They can be inserted under the ground glass like a sheet film holder. Almost all the cameras accept them, but be sure to check for compatibility. The Calumet holders are quite cheap and are now produced in 6x7, 6x9, 6x12 (the latter is quite expensive actually). Sinar has a vario holder which allow you to switch format (from 6x4.5 to 6x12) at any time, for $2500 new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personnally I prefer the second type, because I find them faster to use and it is said that the film flatness is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;polaroid-film&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polaroid film&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polaroid film is a great learning tool because you get instant feedback. Some people recommend that when you start 4x5 you expose Polaroids to begin. Another special application is proofing, to check composition, exposure (esp. with flash), and focus (by luping the negative). But Polaroid material has its own photographic merits, and can yield beautiful prints and negatives. It has been used as a medium by some masters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Polaroid film, all you need is a 4x5 camera, and a Polaroid holder. The sheet film holders are model 545 (older, metal construction) or 545i (current, plastic construction, lighter). They are reasonnably sized so they can also be used with Quickload (and maybe Readyloads, although the failure rate is catastrophic). There are two other Polaroid holders, for pack film, the 550 which accepts 4x5&amp;rdquo; pack film and the 405 which uses 3 1/4x 4 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rdquo; pack film. Packs film are cheaper, but the film area is smaller than 4x5, so that makes them useful mostly for checking exposure. Personally I would just go for the 4x5 image given by the 545 (which is already a bit smaller than 4x5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polaroid also makes material for 8x10 cameras, but it is quite pricey and you also need a special processor, unlike in 4x5 where the holder serves as the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;roll-film&#34;&gt;For more information, call Polaroid to get a free guide to their film. I have personally found type 52 (gives a beautiful print), type 54 (gives a print not as beautiful, but which does not require coating), and type 55 (gives a print AND a negative), and type 56 (gives a beautiful sepia print) useful. Unfortunately with type 55, the negative is about 1.5 stops slower than the print, so you cannot get both well-exposed. The negative needs also a good cleaning to remain usable.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;polaroid55.html&#34;&gt;More details on 55&lt;/a&gt;. All these materials are B&amp;amp;W. I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much experience with the color materials, but I heard they are quite sensitive to heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tripod&#34;&gt;The tripod&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-look-for-in-a-tripod&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to look for in a tripod ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stability/rigidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working height&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease of use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and second points are contradicting, and therefore you have to compromise. A reasonnable choice would be something like a Gitzo series 300 or equivalent. A Gitzo series 400 would hold any view camera. A series 200 would be considered by many to be marginal, but I find it quite usable (see below). Quite a few people use wooden tripods. While it is said that they damp vibrations better than metal tripod, I find that their only real advantage is ruggedness (due actually to a simpler construction, rather than material), and warmer feel. On the other hand, with respect to the four previous points, for a given weight, the metal tripod is always better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-i-have-to-get-a-monster-tripod-for-this-large-format-camera&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I have to get a monster tripod for this large format camera ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need a tripod bigger than the one you use for your small camera. I used to have a very heavy tripod (Zone VI, 16 lbs, ouch !) that i used next to the car, and a Gitzo 226 for hiking and traveling. Since then, i have sold my Zone VI, and use exclusively the Gitzo 1228 with a Linhof Profi II ball head. The combination weights 4lbs, and is quite usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why I think that a light tripod such that the 1228 is plenty adequate for my LF use are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real issue is the rigidity of the legs, NOT the weight of the tripod. With this respect, the Gitzos are pretty good. For the weight, I carry plenty enough. I have put a ring at the bottom of the center column, and attach by camera bag to it. The combo has a heavy weight that cannot be beat !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some medium format or even 35mm settups are in fact heavier than my LF, but I see NO reason why a heavier camera would require a heavier tripod (as long as it does not collapse, of course). Since regardless of the format, blur due to camera shake is mostly a function of focal length, I would tend to say that very stable tripods are needed mostly for very long lenses. Thus if the 1228 is sufficient to hold a 300mm lens for a 35mm camera (and it is), then it is also sufficient to hold a 300m for a 4x5 in still conditions. Most of my LF photography is done with 120 and 210 mm lenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tripod-head-with-qr-system&#34;&gt;Tripod head with QR system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pan-tilt head is more convenient, because it is more easy to level the camera, and you can tilt the camera front to back without unwanted sideway tilt. If your camera does not have levels, it would be useful to have them on your head. A quick release system is very nice to have. Unfortunately the smallest PT head made by Manfrotto which meets all these requirements is the 3047, and although it is nice to use, it weights almost as much as my Gitzo 1228. I also have a smaller PT head, the 3029, but it does not have a built-in QR system, and i find it becomes quite bulky if I attach one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly because of the weight and bulk savings, many photographers use ball heads. An other benefit is that they work better for 35mm and MF if you use a second format. The Linhof Profi II is good enough for most lightweight LF cameras, however, the heavier and more expensive Arca-Swiss B1 is more rigid, smoother, and has an elliptic ball to prevent flip-over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Quick Release (QR) system is not absolutely necessary, but very nice to have, especially if you switch between different formats. You can buy a Manfrotto/Bogen adaptator to use the Bogen hex plates with several ball heads by replacing the stock platform. The spring-loaded Bogen QR system is inexpensive, quick and easy to operate, lock positively and well thanks to the hexagonal shape. If tightened enough, the plates won&amp;rsquo;t slip. However, if you are using at the same time smaller cameras, you might prefer the Arca Swiss system, where you slip the camera plate into a dovetail. With that system, camera plates can be custom made for each camera, which ensures a better fit, while the Bogen plates tend to stick out from small camera bodies. Don&amp;rsquo;t get the generic plates from Arca-Swiss. That would negate most of the advantages of the system ! Really Right Stuff is generally thought to make better fitting plates than Kirk Enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessories&#34;&gt;Accessories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;darkcloth&#34;&gt;Darkcloth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use a jacket, but a dark cloth is preferable and does not cost much anyway compared to the price of the rest of the equipment. A cloth with a white exterior is nice on hot days or if photographing on a busy site. Personnally I don&amp;rsquo;t like those which have weight (ie Zone VI) because if it gets really windy they can fly around and break the ground glass, plus they tend to add weight. A Velcro on the side which is used arround the camera is nice to maintain it in place. For good viewing of the image with slow lenses, I have found that a second velcro is called. One part of the velcro is on the left side of the cloth, the other one on the right side, so that you can close totally the cloth (light coming from under the cloth is otherwise quite distracting). Darkroom Innovations have taken this idea seriously and makes a darkcloth with an elasticized collar that fits around the camera and a velcro-closed slit that you can close totally for excellent darkness. The choice of material makes it light and windproof. It&amp;rsquo;s better than any other darkcloth that I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;focussing-aid&#34;&gt;Focussing aid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except maybe in 8x10, don&amp;rsquo;t trust the naked eye to focus critically. A lupe with a medium magnification, not too big, not too expensive, is the best here. This eliminates the lupes which are usually used for viewing slides on light tables. Unlike in that situation, to focus the view camera you don&amp;rsquo;t need a high quality lupe. On the other hand, there are a few practical requirements: its skirt does not prevent from viewing the corners, it is focussable so that you can make sure it is focussed on the ground glass, and it has attachement for a string so that you can dangle it around your neck. I like the Calumet lupe (7x) for its small size and good magnification. It works well with my very fine-grained Boss Screen but when I had the coarser Canham stock screen, I found it easier to focus with the Toyo (4x). Some people like cheap +4 dioptre glasses. Ron Wisner uses (and sells) a linen tester (an inexpensive folding magnifier that you put in your pocket, and which can be angled for good corner viewing). &amp;ldquo;Hastings Triplets&amp;rdquo; used by geologists are similar, but more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cable-release&#34;&gt;Cable release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid loosing them or spending time to screw/unscrew them, I have a cable release permanently attached to each of my lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;meter&#34;&gt;Meter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pentax digital spot meter seems to be popular with large format photographers. It is relatively small and light, reliable, and has easy controls and viewfinder readings. Recently the multi-purpose Sekonic Zoom-master has been succesfull, because it combines incident and flash with spot. However it is more complex and does not have viewfinder displays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personnally I use my 35mm camera. I like to have the small camera to be able to shoot quickly should something change suddently and produce many images for stock. I also use it as a viewfinder so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to move the tripod around. When I am in a hurry, I use the matrix metering, otherwise I use the a built-in spot meter with the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stop analog scale in the viewfinder. I just set the same shutter speed and f-stop I intend to use on the LF camera, and then see where different part of the scene fall. Cameras with such a scale include the Nikon N8008s, F4, F5, F100 (N90 has only a f1 stop scale), and most canons, including the Rebel 2000 and the EOS 3. If I use the polarizer on the LF camera, I just put a polariser on my 35mm lens. The 24-120 or 24-85 lenses matches all the 4 focals that I commonly use on the LF camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;better-focussing-screen&#34;&gt;Better focussing screen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can replace the focussing screen which comes with your camera, or supplement it with a fresnel lens to obtain a brighter and/or sharper image. After several screens, I have found the Boss screen to be by far the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]{#review}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-review-of-the-f-line&#34;&gt;A review of the F-line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by Barry Sherman, Copyright © 1994&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this camera for a little more than 1 year, have used it
on several one and two week photo trips and have little inclination to
use anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that throughout this there&amp;rsquo;s a noticible prejudice against
folding field cameras and that this is not intended to be a
pronouncement of a universal law, but merely my own preference showing
through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arca Swiss F-Line provides full monorail movements while weighing
and bulking no more than most of the more capable folding field cameras.
I like the camera a lot and have yet to find a camera for which I&amp;rsquo;d
trade it. (Well, maybe a Carbon Infinity, but I&amp;rsquo;d hesitate for fear of
not being able to get that one repaired. Besides which, I haven&amp;rsquo;t won
the lottery yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera just does what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do quickly, easily and
doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in my way. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to ask for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-was-looking-for&#34;&gt;What I was looking for&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a 4x5 camera light enough to carry in a backpack for distances
up to a few miles, rugged enough to carry thusly and with enough
movements to use for architectural and table-top photography as well as
landscapes. I wanted a &amp;ldquo;one-camera-does-everything&amp;rdquo; camera because I
didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to buy another view camera for a good long while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the camera needed to be quick to set up, something which
most folding field cameras appear to me not to be (IMHO, of course).
(Note: John Sparks reports that it takes him no longer to set up his
Canham 8x10 than it does me to set up my Arca Swiss 4x5, except that the
Arca Swiss can be stored with lens attached.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major contenders for my interest were the Wisner Technical and the
Linhof Technikardan. The Linhof Technika would have been a contender
save for the price of the more recent models. I chose the Arca because
it has movements equal to or greater than any of these cameras, weighs
in the same ballpark and, while it will not focus lenses as long as will
the Wisner or the Technikardan, it has the advantage of being part of a
monorail system, allowing expansion of its capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;ll try to offend as many people as possible :-) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t consider the Sinar A1 because it&amp;rsquo;s just too bulky for my
tastes, didn&amp;rsquo;t consider the Zone VI because of reports from too many
people that the fit of the pieces and quality control aren&amp;rsquo;t up to snuff
(but boy they sure are purty! :-), didn&amp;rsquo;t consider the Horseman, Toyo or
Wista metal field cameras because their movements and bellows draw are
more restrictive than I want and didn&amp;rsquo;t consider the Toyo VX125 (sp?)
because it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been introduced at the time and besides which it costs
far more than I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;specs&#34;&gt;Specs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOTE:  the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; position of the front and rear standard rise/fall
       is all the way down.  Thus the spec. for rise/fall is actually
       for rise alone for each standard, although one may certainly
       chose to zero each standard at the midpoint of this movement.

NOTE:  When I went to write this I found that I no longer have the
       factory specs on this camera and so everything that I state here
       is from my own manual measurements.  Thus there may be some
       discrepency from published factory specs.


Max. Flange Focal Length:  (bellows draw)     15 5/8 inches  (382mm)

Min. Flange Focal Length:  (bellows draw)     2 inches (50mm) with
optional wide-angle bellows installed

Rise:              + 4 inches (98mm) both front and rear

Shift:             +/- 3.25 inches (75mm) either side of &amp;quot;zero&amp;quot;
           both front and rear

Swing:             limited by bellows front and rear

Base Tilt:         +/- 30 degrees front and rear

Axis Tilt:         none

Geared Movements:  front and rear focusing only.

Back type:         graflok

Back movements:    switches between horizontal and
           vertical in seconds but doesn&#39;t rotate

&amp;quot;Zero detents&amp;quot;:    All movements except for rise, which

Weight:            7.5 lbs.  NOTE:  Specs say that the Linhof Master
                                    Technika weighs 7.0 lbs and the 
                                    Wisner Technical weighs 6.5 lbs.

Cost:              I paid $1,900 for the body, new
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I carry this camera the way that others carry a folding field camera and
am able to do this because of the way that it disassembles. The monorail
actually consists of three pieces. There&amp;rsquo;s one piece about 12 inches
long which attaches to the tripod. Atop this, sliding in &amp;ldquo;dovetails&amp;rdquo; in
the bottom piece, are two shorter pieces each about 6 inches long. Each
of these is locked in place by a cam-action lever and can be slid to the
front or rear as appropriate and then locked in place to increase the
overall length of the monorail. Thus you can leave the two upper
segments touching and have a 12 inch monorail or slide them apart and
have one nearly 18 inches long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front and rear standards of the camera slide onto these upper
monorail pieces and move along them to provide focusing. Thus, you can
move the front standard onto the upper front monorail segment, move the
rear standard onto the upper rear monorail segment and then separate
these segments by sliding them forward and backward as appropriate to
attain the full 15 &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; inch (flange focal length) extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;rsquo;s time to put the camera away, you slide the two upper monorail
segments together so that they form one continuous rail and then slide
both the front and rear standard onto one of the upper segments. After
locking the standards in place with the focus lock, you can unlock that
upper monorail segment itself and remove it, with front and rear
standards attached to it, from the lower monorail arm. This reduces the
camera to a size very little larger than most folding field cameras, be
they wood or metal. Next the lower monorail segment, with the remaining
upper segment attached, is removed from the tripod and put in the
backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, setup is the opposite of this operation and goes very
quickly. Just attach the lower monorail segment to the tripod, slide the
upper segment with both standards attached onto the lower segment, move
the two standards the appropriate distance apart and the camera&amp;rsquo;s ready
to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few people can get a folding field camera set up in the 15 seconds
that it usually takes me to set up the Arca Swiss. (not counting setting
up the tripod, of course) This speed is abetted by the fact that I can
leave the lens attached, something that one cannot do with most folding
field cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the down side, the camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t fold up into a box, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t
provide protection for the groundglass. But I&amp;rsquo;ve only had one problem
with damage to the camera and that was caused by improper packing on my
part when I checked the camera in its soft backpack as airline baggage.
I now load the entire backpack and tripod into a very large hard-sided
suitcase and then check *that*. And I find that a Calumet groundglass
protector prevents damage to the groundglass quite nicely since I
reinforced it with a second thickness of ABS plastic. (No, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the
Arca groundglass that was broken before I reinforced the protector - it
was the Bender Kit groundglass.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;What i like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The camera&amp;rsquo;s really rigid. My previous two cameras were a Bender Kit
which was not very rigid at all and a Calumet 400 series which was
also not very rigid. By comparison, this thing&amp;rsquo;s a tank. Of course,
it&amp;rsquo;s pretty wobbly compared to a 15-20 lb. studio monorail, but few
people will carry a studio monorail into the field. Anyway, nothing
moves out of alignment when locked and when inserting film holders.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movements work very nicely. I don&amp;rsquo;t really notice the lack of
gearing on them. Controls are well thought out and logical in
placement. Nearly mnemonic. Locks lock without having to use
excessive force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been caught in a sandstorm while photographing with the Arca
and 1) Was able to continue working afterward, despite definite
grittiness in the movements and 2) was able to clean the sand and
dust out of the mechanisms easily later that day back at the motel.
The mechanisms are easy to disassemble and reassemble if you have
the right tools - just a couple of small hex-wrenches and
screwdrivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wide-angle bellows is a dream. This is not a bag but rather a
pleated leather bellows made from incredibly soft leather and with
really large pleats. It&amp;rsquo;s so supple that even at the minimum flange
focal length of 2 inches I can get 2 inches of rise from the
standards. That&amp;rsquo;s incredible! Granted, that&amp;rsquo;s far more rise than any
short lens could provide in its image circle. I mention it only as
an illustration of how supple the bellows is. In addition, it
extends long enough to use it with a 210mm lens provided that only
modest movements are being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the regular bellows is usable with lenses down to 135mm,
provided that only moderate movements are used or with a 90mm lens
if very minimal movements are used. What this means is that I don&amp;rsquo;t
have to change between the two bellows very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, the wide-angle bellows doesn&amp;rsquo;t protrude into the light
path as have some bag bellows that I&amp;rsquo;ve used. I&amp;rsquo;ve used bag bellows
which had to be carefully pulled and adjusted after the camera was
set up because they&amp;rsquo;d deform and protrude into the light path. This
Arca Swiss wide-angle bellows, through some magical properties of
physics unknown to me, never does this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the downside: the price of the wonderful leather wide-angle
bellows was \$500. Ouch! They also make a synthetic wide-angle
bellows for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that price but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t locate any when I bought
the camera and so bit the bullet and got the leather one. Now that
I&amp;rsquo;ve absorbed the cost I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I did as it&amp;rsquo;s really a joy to
work with, but it really hurt at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extension bellows, required if lenses longer than 300mm in a
normal lens or 500mm in a telephoto design are to be used, costs,
you guessed it, about \$500. This has kept me from extending the
capabilities of the camera to date. That and not having the money
for a longer lens anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera comes with a built-in fresnel lens which works better
than those which I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camera has &amp;ldquo;zero detents&amp;rdquo; on all movements. A delightful convenience
after the Bender which has zero detents on no movements and the
Calumet, whose zero detents were inoperable due to rust. (Apparently
the zero detents were the one place that I failed to clean after the
Calumet went swimming in the Pacific Ocean. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was worried that, after being accustomed to center tilts, I&amp;rsquo;d find
base tilts difficult to use. Not only do I not find this to be the
case, I really like the ease of being able to combine both swing and
tilt on the same standard without getting weird distortions caused
by yaw. Certainly, with my other two cameras with their center tilts
I can avoid yaw by using the cameras tilted 90 degrees on their
sides, but that&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who sold the camera to me commented that I&amp;rsquo;d be surprised
at how quickly the camera would just kind of fade into the
background and do what I wanted it to, compared to some of the
hassles that I&amp;rsquo;d had with the Bender and the Calumet.
He was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-dislike-about-it&#34;&gt;What I dislike about it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lens boards are ludicrously large - nearly 7 inches square! Way
to large to store several lenses in a backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not lost, however, as Keith Canham, maker of the Canham view
cameras, has produced an adaptor which allows one to use Linhof
Technika style lens boards on the Arca Swiss. So my lenses are
mounted in Technika style (actually they&amp;rsquo;re labeled Wista) lens
boards. This adaptor is on the one Arca lens board that I have which
stays mounted on the camera at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the cost of the adaptor was \$250 (rather a lot, I
think). And I&amp;rsquo;m not completely satisfied with the quality of the
adaptor as a couple of anodized studs and a leaf spring both show
signs of rust after spending a couple of weeks in Hawaii. This
doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to reflect the level of quality that I expected, given
the name of the manufacturor and the price. But the adaptor
*works* just fine and I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with it overall. I&amp;rsquo;d never have
considered using this camera in the field without being able to use
smaller lens boards and this makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot remove the fresnel lens if I want to as focus shifts
minutely when I do. The fresnel lens and groundglass are mounted
such that the fresnel lens is *not* acting as a spacer for the
groundglass, but for some reason focus definitely shifts when I try
to remove it. Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the better groundglass
brightening systems that I&amp;rsquo;ve used so I don&amp;rsquo;t mind it too much, but
I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to have options here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support sucks. This may have improved, however. But at the time that
I bought it, there was no official Arca distributor in the U.S. The
person from whom I bought it, a salesman in a camera store near
Phoenix AZ, assured me that his connections with people at the
manufacturor in Switzerland would allow him to obtain parts easily.
And he was most prompt about shipping the camera and other
accessories to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the camera was broken by airline baggage handlers (actually
by my own poor packing), it took 6 months and several phone calls to
get the repair parts. As it happened, I was able to mend it
immediately on my own but I felt more comfortable having officially
unbroken parts and was not at all pleased with the slow response. It
appeared strongly to me that my broken camera was not a high
priority with this person and my view of hims is somewhat jaundiced
as a result. (I.e. he did not appear to me to pursue matters with
the people in Switzerland with any great zeal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ads in magazines which indicate that there is now
an official Arca Swiss distributor for the U.S. so accessories and
parts may now be easier to come by. Plus, the person from whom I
bought it has told me that he&amp;rsquo;s a distributor for the SW U.S. so I
have some hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a little heavier than I&amp;rsquo;d like. Like about 3-4 lbs heavier. But
most every other camera which has the features that I want weighs in
the same ballpark so I&amp;rsquo;m not really complaining. And if I want to
walk more than a few miles then I can always trade the Arca for the
Bender Kit which only weighs 3 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that I&amp;rsquo;m not coming up with any real user complaints? That&amp;rsquo;s
because I don&amp;rsquo;t have any!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

focus (just slide and lock), knobs on function blocks are cream-colored.

You can add all Arca Accessories to the Discovery to upgrade including
fresnel, additional rail/bellows, etc. &lt;strong&gt;Don Nelson&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has axial tilts instead of base tilts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has serrated plastic knobs instead of rubberized ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metal surfaces are not black-anodized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rail doesn&amp;rsquo;t collapse/expand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are flash shoes on the front and rear standards(!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No fresnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No grid lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No serial numbers(?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standards have rounded edges instead of sharply-squared ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any scales except for rise, and only at .5 cm
intervals at that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lens boards and rails are supposedly compatible, but the bellows are
not. Worse, I rented a 90mm lens (Caltar II-N) on a recessed lens board
and discovered that the construction of the camera won&amp;rsquo;t permit infinity
focus with this lens! &lt;strong&gt;Alvin Chia-Hua Shih&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;older-and-newer-f-line-models&#34;&gt;Older and newer F-line models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older style F-line standards definitely fit on the newer high
profile rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you might contact Rod Klukas at Photomark. He currently has a
bunch of the older style rails and bridges at a good price (a couple of
folding low profile rail). Photomark is at 602-244-1133. Patience is
sometimes necessary as he&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of business&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is at least two folding low profile rails(from two FC cameras) and
a longer bridge with a section of low profile rails. (Excellent
condition)&lt;/p&gt;

literature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arca Swiss 6 x 9 FC: a review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arca-swiss-6-x-9-fc-a-review&#34;&gt;Arca Swiss 6 x 9 FC: a review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:jocome@cris.com&#34;&gt;J. C. Metcalf&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;the Large Format
Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason the Arca Swiss 6 x 9 FC view camera tends to be
overlooked in reviews of this format. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arca Swiss 6x9 is a very high quality, easily transportable full
featured monorail camera. The camera is extremely compact. The &amp;ldquo;FC&amp;rdquo;
designates a monorail that folds in half for easy storage. For use, the
two monorail sections screw easily and quickly together. The front and
rear standards ride on geared blocks on the monorail. The monorail
itself slides into a 3.25&amp;rdquo; dovetailed rail clamp that screws to the
tripod. An adjustable lever on the side of the clamp tightens it against
the monorail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arca 6x9 FC has front and rear base tilts, front and rear side to
side sliding movements, 3&amp;rdquo; of front rise and 3&amp;rdquo; of rear rise, front and
rear swings. There are built in levels both front and rear. All
movements are smooth, sold and precise. In five years of pretty
demanding use I have never had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All movements can be locked with nicely designed and easy to use round
knobs that have never stuck. It comes with flat and recessed lens
boards. The standard rail is 12&amp;rdquo; long and additional, longer, rails are
available. The standard bellows is 10&amp;rdquo; and is an extremely flexible soft
pleated leather that is useable for the shortest lens I have (47mm
Schneider Super Angulon) to the longest I have (270mm Nikon Telephoto).
Longer bellows are available as is a wide angle bellows. The standard
bellows is really enough. The camera weighs just over 5 lbs. and is
easier to deal with than a Hasselblad. Why ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 6x9 Arca itself packs up in less room than the Hasselblad (I&amp;rsquo;ve
tested it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;view camera lenses on lens board take up less room than comparable
slr lenses. Compare, for example the volume of Hassie 250mm with the
Nikon 270 tele or compare either the the 47mm schneider (very small)
or 58mm schneider (bigger but still smaller than 50mm Hassie) with
the 50mm Hassie. 6x9 normal lens is the Nikon 105mm, noticeably
smaller than Hassie 80mm standard lens. View camera lenses all stop
down further than slr lenses (due to simpler shutter design). If
you&amp;rsquo;ve got standing aspen trees from 5 feet in front of the camera
to infinity you are glad to be able to stop down to f45. View camera
lenses, though certainly not cheap, cost less than comparable slr
lenses, again due to simpler design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No extra close up attachments are needed with view camera - with
Hassie you need one or two extension tubes that do take up room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the roll film backs for the Arca are about the same &amp;ldquo;volume&amp;rdquo; as the
Hassie - no real diff there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ground glass viewing on the 6x9 view camera is much easier than
ground glass viewing on the Hassie. If you use one of the Hassie
viewing attachments you add significant weight and bulk. The ground
glass on the 6x9 Arca is small enough that rarely do I feel the need
for a focussing cloth, and when I do, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a 2&amp;rsquo;x2&amp;rsquo; piece of dark
blue waterproof cordura nylon that works fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having view camera adjustments is, to me, a true inconvenience -
converging lines in buildings, out of focus foregrounds and
backgrounds are burrs under my saddle - maybe idiosyncratic, but I
can&amp;rsquo;t help it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the one feature the Hasselblad system has that I&amp;rsquo;ve not been able to
duplicate with a view camera is the superb Hasselblad bellows lens
shade and the same diameter bayonet attachment on the front of all
lenses from 38mm to 250mm. To me this is very minor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FILM. Roll film backs are &amp;ldquo;graflock&amp;rdquo; style. To use the film back the
ground glass is removed. The roll film back then attaches to a roll film
back holder which then locks onto the camera back. The process of
removing the ground glass and attaching the film back to the holder and
camera takes less than 10 seconds. I use four backs (b &amp;amp; w for &amp;ldquo;normal,&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;plus,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;minus,&amp;rdquo; development and one back for color.) One holder for
the film backs is adequate. Polaroid film packs are easily used with the
NPC Polaroid adapter or the Arca Swiss Polaroid adapter. The NPC I have
has been trouble free for 5 years and was about half the price of the
Arca Swiss item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversion to 4 x 5 is a snap. The Arca Swiss 4 x 5 F and FC are
virtually identical (except size) to the 6x9. The 4x5 uses the same
monorail and monorail clamp as the 6x9. Therefore, to use 4x5 all you
need is a 4x5 back and the available tapered bellows that allows use of
the 6x9 front standard with the 4x5 back. You can then use the much
smaller 6x9 metal lensboards (4.25&amp;rdquo; square). The 4x5 back is &amp;ldquo;graflock&amp;rdquo;
style meaning it can use roll film holders as well as standard sheet
film holders. Now Arca Swiss is offering something called the 4 x 5 FC
line Field. This new 4 x 5 is described as being a 4 x 5 camera with a 6
x 9 front and a tapered bellows. I assume this means that a camera one
could assemble by purchasing accessory parts is now offered as a unit. I
saw this &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; camera advertised by &amp;ldquo;the F Stops here&amp;rdquo; in Shutterbug -
but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it in person. It does offer another &amp;ldquo;off the shelf&amp;rdquo; 4
x 5 option that will be somewhat more compact and lighter than the
previous off the shelf Arca Swiss 4 x 5. &lt;em&gt;NdE: I met on an Olympic NP
beach a photographer from Switzerland who was using the mixed 4x5 / 6x9
F-line camera with roll-film. He said that although he uses only
roll-film, he still prefered to use 4x5 so that he could do 6x12 (he had
a Sinar zoom back that the seemed to like a lot). His reason for using
the 6x9 camera was to save one pound of weight, and the smaller
lensboards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had five years of experience with this camera. It has gone to
Europe four times. The camera, five lenses, four roll film holders,
eight screw in filters fit securely into a small Lightware medium format
case that can be carried on to your airplane and put in the overhead
luggage bin. The camera has made a number of domestic flights, been
backpacking around the Rocky Mountains, travelled the high plains, the
Utah desert, New Mexico and the Olympic Penninsula rain forest. I use it
often in the studio, especially for portraits and figures, in preference
to 4x5 and 8x10. Results? It has never disappointed. Modern lenses and
TMX 100 film (EI 64) developed in TMX RS give great results. 20&amp;rdquo;x12.5&amp;rdquo;
enlargments are astonishingly sharp - individual hairs, skin blemishes,
grass, twigs, leaves are crisp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price today is probably around \$2,500.00. Less expensive than Horseman
or Linhof medium format view cameras. Toyo is probably a little less
expensive. Horseman is less versatile. Linhof is comparable though not
quite as versative. Toyo is comparable in movements and versatility but
weighs 8.5lbs and is not as compact. Support - Calumet (&lt;sup&gt;800&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;225&lt;/sub&gt;-8638)
now supplies and supports Arca Swiss. Calumet is reliable, trustworthy,
and if they don&amp;rsquo;t have it they&amp;rsquo;ll get it. The Calumet prices are better
than most retail outlets and the difference in price between Calumet and
New York discounters reflects the enhanced service and competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large Format Photography: Bruce Barnbaum workshop - trip report&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bruce-barnbaum-workshop-trip-report&#34;&gt;Bruce Barnbaum workshop: trip report&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:bjs@oes.amdahl.com&#34;&gt;Barry Sherman&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;the Large Format
Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAUTION:   The following posting contains non-sacreligious profanity.

CAUTION:   The following posting challenges some cherished notions.

CAUTION:   This is *really* long.

NOTE:      At times below I&#39;ll &amp;quot;quote&amp;quot; Bruce Barnbaum.  Mostly these
           aren&#39;t precise quotes but are used to try to capture the spirit of 
           what he said and how he said it.


I just returned from a 5.5 day workshop with Bruce Barnbaum and Don
Kirby.  Since there are occasional queries about good workshops to
attend, I thought I&#39;d do a big write-up about this one.  I&#39;m not going
to go into great detail about techniques as I think that attending the
workshop, or at the very least buying Bruce&#39;s book, will be of more
benefit than the sketchy details that I could discuss here.

Cost:   $475 + $75 lab fee.  I understand that the lab fee is going up to
        $150 as of now.  This cost is exclusive of lodging, food and 
        transportation and inclusive of use of Bruce&#39;s outstanding darkroom,
        equipped with 7 Saunders 4500 enlarger.  Lodging 
        at the nearby Mountain View Inn runs $20 per night if you&#39;re willing to    
        room with someone (recommended as there are 12 students in the workshop
        and only 6 rooms at the motel, the only motel around).  I, however, 
        made it known that I really wanted a private room and was able to have 
        one.  (thereby saving some poor soul from utter exhaustion from being 
        kept awake by my snoring  :-)  This made my lodging $40 per night.
        The lab fee includes all the 8x10 Kodak Elite paper that you want to 
        use during the lab sessions.

        Come to think of it, there are camp grounds nearby and people with
        campers are welcome to stay on their grounds and use their shower.

Where:  At Bruce&#39;s home in the Northern Cascade mountains in Washington
        state.  He lives outside of Granite Falls.  Beautiful location.
        People flew and drove in from California, Michigan, Texas, Nebraska,
        Arizona, New Jersey and, even, Washington (state).

Title:  &amp;quot;Complete Photographic Process&amp;quot;  Bruce does many workshops.  This
        one is devoted to black/white photography from exposure of the
        negative to mounting/spotting of the print.  Although there are
        3 field sessions during which you can expose film, and darkroom
        time allotted to negative development, students are encouraged
        to bring negatives with them, especially &amp;quot;problem negatives&amp;quot;,
        so as to be able to rework old images under the instructors&#39;
        tutelege.  Printing in his great darkroom using Saunders 4500
        enlargers with Dichro heads is a promiment feature of the workshop.

        BTW - this was my first actual use of the Saunders.  Great enlarger.  
        Nice bright bulb, easy to use controls, very, very rigid and all around
        a pleasure to use.  If I get a second enlarger I&#39;ll give very serious 
        thought to this one.

When:   Four times per year - Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall.

Who they are: 
--- ---- ----

  Bruce Barnbaum is one of the world&#39;s most highly acclaimed b/w landscape 
  photographers.  His work is available in galleries throughout the U.S.  I 
  was interested to learn that he has made stunning color (Ilfochrome) images 
  as well.  If &amp;quot;money is the most sincere form of appreciation&amp;quot;, then 
  consider:  his UNlimited edition 16x20&#39;s now command $750 and his limited 
  edition 20x24&#39;s go for $2,500.

  But if you don&#39;t believe in price as a measure of one&#39;s work, then:

  He showed us his work every evening after dinner.  Beyond belief.  This guy 
  is incredibly good.  Image after stunning image after exquisite image.  He 
  showed us between 80 and 100 prints throughout the course of the workshop 
  and, while some were not really to my personal taste, the quality was always 
  wonderful.  One might say &amp;quot;What is this?  I pay hundreds of dollars to stare 
  at someone else&#39;s photography?&amp;quot; But these &amp;quot;exhibitions&amp;quot; involved lots of 
  questions and discussion ranging from technique to philosophy and were 
  highly worthwhile.  And just plain interesting.  Some of his anecdotes about 
  photographing in slit canyons (and just missing a horrendous flash flood)
  were fascinating and downright frightening.  And I can&#39;t wait to hike the 
  length of Buckskin Gulch!

  Bruce is one of the most dynamic people I&#39;ve ever encountered.  He seems
  to bring an enormous passion to everything he does.  I&#39;m certain that
  this is a large part of the reason for his success.  It doesn&#39;t matter 
  whether he&#39;s exposing film, printing, listening to classical music, 
  fighting the proposed quarry which may destroy his lovely community or 
  fighting the clear-cutting which is destroying so much forest habitat. 
  Whatever he does, he does with every fiber of his being.  At some times I 
  found his intensity somewhat off-putting but at the same time I developed 
  great admiration and respect for him.  Plus, he has an inexhaustable supply 
  of really great jokes and anecdotes, which he shares at every opportunity.  
  Incredible supply of &amp;quot;groaners&amp;quot;.  Really terribly funny &amp;quot;groaners&amp;quot;.  :-)  
  E.g:  &amp;quot;You gotta pity poor David Koresh.  All his life he wanted to be a 
  priest but in the end he was only a friar.&amp;quot;  All together now:  
  Grrrooooooaaaaaannnnn.  :-)

  Don Kirby is, perhaps, less well known but is a marvelous photographer as 
  well.  Similarly, every evening he showed us his work and it was humbling.  
  His interests seem to be largely Anasazi ruins, which he&#39;s explored
  extensively for the last 10 or more years, wheat fields in their 
  infinite variety of form, and abstract patterns in rock.  Don is more
  laid back but I detect a passion for the natural world as deep as
  Bruce&#39;s.  Don&#39;s printing, like Bruce&#39;s, combines the bold with the subtle
  in a wonderfully expressive way.  Like Bruce, he&#39;s an excellent teacher,
  able to explain the complex, patient and genuinely interested in helping
  people to grow.

  I&#39;m impressed with Don in another way.  He not too long ago realized
  a 10 year goal:  early retirement and delving completely into his
  photography.  For the last decade he&#39;s worked at building a body of work
  and taken much time off from work without pay in order to photograph and
  to assist other photographers in teaching their workshops.  He is now
  co-instructor of this workshop and others with Bruce and will be leading
  his own in the near future (exploring Anasazi ruins in So. Utah).  I&#39;m
  really happy to see as good a person as Don being able to realize his
  dreams.

  All in all, two very remarkable people.  Oh, and for those of us in the Bay
  area, the work of both photographers may be viewed at the Photographers 
  Gallery in Palo Alto.  I&#39;ve not been there since Bruce&#39;s exhibit opened 
  there 1.5 years ago but will get there soon to see Don&#39;s work.

What the workshop is NOT:  
---- --- -------- -- ---

  It&#39;s *not* about any of the following:

  * Lenses
  * Cameras
  * Lp/mm
  * &amp;quot;Rules of composition&amp;quot;
  * Rules of pretty much any sort - Mr.&#39;s Barnbaum and Kirby are happy to
    tell you how they do things while maintaining that the student should
    be comfortable doing things completely differently if that&#39;s what works
    for the student.  For example, Bruce doesn&#39;t permit anything that beeps 
    in his darkroom.  But if you prefer a metronome, mechanical or electronic, 
    then use one.  Just find what works for you and then do it.  (As long as
    you don&#39;t try to bring chirpers or beepers into Bruce&#39;s darkroom. :-)
  * Introductory darkroom procedure
  * Mathematical formulae
  * A &amp;quot;fun photo tour&amp;quot;
  * A light skimming-over of everyone&#39;s work at the critique.
  * An ego building &amp;quot;soft-soap&amp;quot; praising of mediocre images during the 
    critique.
  * Slides.  Although I do think that a &amp;quot;strictly slides&amp;quot; photographer or a 
    color printer could benefit greatly from the workshop, it&#39;s really oriented
    toward b/w printing.  My color work, and I was the only person in the class
    who showed color work, was well received by both Bruce and Don, but, as I 
    said, the real purpose of the class is b/w prints.

  Not once during the 85 hours that I was around Bruce and Don did they 
  mention gear other than wrt darkroom stuff and in response to questions.  
  They would discuss equipment in response to questions and at great length.
  But rarely did they raise the subject themselves.

  Bruce, btw, uses the old-style &amp;quot;Time-o-Light&amp;quot; timers on the enlarger, 
  refuses to have anything that beeps in the darkroom, and seems to time
  his dodging and burning by intuition.  With incredibly consistent
  results.  I made a point of not mentioning my two-memory, multi-mode, beeping,
  digital electronic enlarger timer.  Nor my Zone VI Compensating
  Developing Timer.  :-)

  They are concerned with the production of images and seem to have little 
  interest in gear, per se.  I found this refreshing.  I gather that Bruce 
  uses a Linhof Technika (from photos of him with his camera) with a Tilt-all 
  tripod.  He&#39;s becoming quite enamored of his Mamiya 645, although he 
  considers the image to be of insufficient quality to replace the 4x5, 
  deeming it more appropriate for &amp;quot;hand-held&amp;quot; work.  Don uses a Technika
  as well.

What the workshop *is*:
---- --- -------- ----

  * Intensive.  We went from 7:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. every day except
    the final day which as a half day.  Monday morning through Saturday
    noon.  I normally drink 50/50 real and decaffeinated coffee as the pure 
    stuff really affects me strongly.  But during the workshop I was drinking 
    the real thing all day and most of the evening and hardly noticed the 
    caffein.  Not a place for those who cannot function on less than 8 hours 
    of sleep per night.  Nor a place for those for whom photography is a minor 
    part of their lives or whose interests lie more in hardware than in images.

  * A place at which people who are committed to this form of artistic 
    expression have the opportunity to grow.

  * As much about what&#39;s going on inside the photographer as about 
    specific techniques.

  * Excellent in every respect.  Oh, BTW, Bruce&#39;s wife, Karen, was a 
    wonderful hostess, making everyone feel welcome and comfortable
    in their home.  I&#39;ve come to think that once one leaves the urban
    areas it becomes impossible to find a cup of coffee that tastes like
    coffee instead of warm water.  But they served really great (and really
    strong) coffee and great goodies to munch on during the long sessions
    and this added to the pleasure of the class.  Even their dogs and cats 
    added a lot of enjoyment to the class. 

What they teach:
---- ---- -----

  * Composition and light.  But he never once mentioned &amp;quot;rule of thirds&amp;quot;
    or other &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot;.  BTW - if you ask &amp;quot;then what is there to discuss about 
    composition?&amp;quot; then you *really* need to take this workshop.  I did.

  * Intro to the zone system 101.  Or advanced study, depending on the
    group.  But he&#39;s not a fanatic about it.  He believes in making images,
    not in spending a lot of time testing materials.  He notes that he&#39;s yet
    to see an exciting image from those people who are heavy into testing
    of materials.  He didn&#39;t mention names, but I&#39;d already noticed the
    same thing in the articles on materials testing by the &amp;quot;big names&amp;quot; that
    I see in the magazines.  (Well, John Sexton might be an exception, but
    there are always exceptions.)

  * His film development techniques.  Basically he uses Tri-X in HC110,
    exposed at EI of 160, although he&#39;s switching to HP5 because he thinks
    that it&#39;s &amp;quot;smoother&amp;quot; and he can expose it at EI 300.  He uses hangers/
    tank development and uses extremely dilute HC110 for &amp;quot;extreme contraction
    and compensation&amp;quot; development, such as for his exquisite slit canyon
    images and his awe-inspiring series on the interiors of the great 
    cathedrals of England.  These go down to N-6 but the prints are 
    marvelous.

    I questioned them because I noticed in some test prints that Don showed
    featuring extreme contractions that highlight contrast was really low.
    The highlights printed along with the shadows on #2 paper but were very
    flat and lifeless.  I was puzzled because I knew that the highlights in
    their fine prints are lively and full, even in those cathedral interiors
    where I knew that extreme &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; development had been given.

    The answer was that you just have to use a higher grade of paper so as
    to get the sparkle in the highlights and then you live with having to 
    dodge the shadows and burn and flash the highlights.  

    Bruce went on to say that he considers it a major error to try to select
    paper grade based on what will allow both highlights and shadows to
    print without dodging or burning:  paper grade should be selected on
    the basis of local contrast and overall effect, not by an arbitrary 
    standard based on how much manipulation you have to do.  He said that
    when people do select contrast grade based on overall density range in 
    the negative, the prints seem to be flat and uninteresting.  I wouldn&#39;t
    make so general a statement about other&#39;s printing, but have noticed 
    that to be true in my own printing.

    This was very heartening for me as I used to think that I had problems
    with highlights because I had to burn them a lot if I chose a contrast 
    grade high enough to make local contrast look pleasing.  Now he&#39;s 
    confirmed what I&#39;ve been coming to realize on my own:  it&#39;s just in 
    the nature of the medium.  My &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot;, always having to do lots of
    burning of highlights, is this master printer&#39;s normal way of working.

    He had a &amp;quot;self-published&amp;quot; copy of his text book (which will be formally
    published in the near future) and it contained his development times for 
    both N +/- and compensating (extreme contraction).  I&#39;ll not post them 
    now as this is available from him in either the workshop or in his book.

    I bought a copy of this self-published version for $20 and think that
    it&#39;s worth far more.  The formally published version, complete with
    photographs and other illustrations, should be an outstanding text,
    delving into the philosophy of photography and composition as well
    as the mechanics of the process from exposure through mounting and
    spotting.

  * His sophisticated printing techniques.  We watched him print three new
    negatives for the first time.  In 1.5 hours he had created  what I
    consider to be a masterpiece, far beyond anything I&#39;ve ever accomplished,
    regardless of how many weeks I&#39;ve worked on a print.  He employed the 
    following techniques:

    - contrast grade selection (he works with Oriental Seagull graded and
      O.S. VC Select almost exclusively and for this print he used
      the graded).

    - Split developing to fine-tune contrast using both Selectol-Soft and
      Dektol on the same print.  (Using his personal system of diluting the
      stock solutions double what the manufacturor recommends and then
      doubling development time.)  With his long development times he doesn&#39;t
      worry about timing things.  Just goes with how the image looks and
      his own (very accurate) internal clock.  His intent is to develop
      to completion and as long as that happens he figures that timing isn&#39;t
      terribly important.  He also doesn&#39;t measure terribly accurately.  When 
      he thinks that the developer is getting a little exhausted, he just 
      picks up the jug of stock solution and &amp;quot;pours a bit in&amp;quot; without 
      measuring.  Yet he gets very consistent results.  Methinks that there&#39;s 
      a certain amount of intuitive genius going on here.  And maybe my 
      mechanistic, timed, measured approach is not really needed.  Might even 
      be distracting me from the important parts of printing?

      More than anything, I think that he was trying to wean us (or some of
      us? :-) from our mechanical aids and toward a more intuitive and
      sensing approach to photography.  He was very disgusted with the
      &amp;quot;focus gauge&amp;quot; that I&#39;ve been using, for example.  &amp;quot;Too mechanical!&amp;quot;
      &amp;quot;Gadgetry won&#39;t make your photos interesting!&amp;quot;  (Not real quotes,
      just attempts to capture the spirit of his comments.)

    - Dodging and burning using some really neat home-made burning tools.
      I&#39;ve used something similar but he&#39;s refined the idea.  I&#39;ll be
      making some for myself asap.

    - Selective pre-flashing of dense (in the negative) highlight areas.
      Hmmmmm.  Actually it was &amp;quot;post-flashing&amp;quot; as he gave the flashing
      exposure after the main exposure.

    - Ferricyanide (aka Farmer&#39;s Reducer) bleaching of selected areas of 
      the final print.  This, btw, is different from dodging.  Dodging reduces
      density overall in the area dodged.  Bleaching increases contrast by
      affecting lighter areas more than darker ones.  Select your tool
      as the individual case suggests.  Also, bleaching can affect a far
      smaller area than can dodging.

      I&#39;ve used this technique myself but never had any idea that you
      could do the things that this guy does.  The difference between
      the unbleached and the bleached print was subtle but dramatic.
      The difference between a &amp;quot;nice print&amp;quot; and a masterpiece.

      I&#39;ll not discuss bleaching in greater detail, but will note that both
      Bruce&#39;s textbook and Ansel Adam&#39;s &amp;quot;The Print&amp;quot; give good pointers to get
      you started.

    - Print washing:  he&#39;s somewhat cynical about the entire archival
      ruckus.  He pointed out that every time you turn around there&#39;s some
      new theory about what&#39;s going to produce an &amp;quot;archival print&amp;quot; and
      how to wash, etc.  Plus he has, as do I, minimal confidence in
      accelerated aging tests.  Putting it all together, he didn&#39;t quite
      say that &amp;quot;archival processing is a crock of s***&amp;quot;, but came very near
      to doing so.  And, being a fairly earthy person, that&#39;s pretty close
      to how he would have expressed it.

      I didn&#39;t really know quite what to expect from him but was pleased 
      and made to feel quite comfortable when 1)  He commented that &amp;quot;if
      this isn&#39;t an archival wash I don&#39;t really give a s***&amp;quot; and 2)  First
      thing at dinner was to get the carafe of red wine *NOW*!!.  This
      guy I can identify with.  :-)

      He puts his prints in a holding bath for anywhere from several hours
      to a day or so.  Ack!  We&#39;re leaching out all those brighteners,
      right?  He contends that he can see no difference between a print 
      soaked for 24 hours and one soaked for 10 minutes.  Personally I&#39;ve been
      thinking the same for some time now.  His prints glow.  Absolutely glow.  
      Unexcelled luminosity, especially in the highlights.  If this what a 
      print looks like after it&#39;s lost its brighteners, then you can remove 
      all brighteners from my paper, thank you very kindly.

      After the holding bath he selenium tones and uses an HCA bath.   BTW -
      he uses quite dilute selenium to minimize his use of heavy metals
      and soaks prints for a long time.  At that point he figures that there 
      can be virtually no fixer left in the paper.  So his final wash consists 
      of soaking each print individually in a try of water for at least 10 
      minutes and then pouring the water out.  He goes through this loop 3 
      times, squeegees the prints and air drys them on screens.

      Yup.  He doesn&#39;t own an archival print washer.  And here I just
      bought one!

      I also note that experts agree that using his &amp;quot;soak-drain&amp;quot; method
      of washing for an hour will produce an &amp;quot;archival wash&amp;quot;, whatever
      that means.  He&#39;s only doing so for 30 minutes, but with all the soaking
      that they&#39;re getting before the final wash, I strongly suspect that
      he&#39;s, unwittingly :-), getting an &amp;quot;archival wash&amp;quot;, whatever
      (once again) that is.

  - There is no drydown!  Basically, drydown is an artifact of viewing
    prints with dark-adapted eyes under overly bright lights.  He has an
    article on just this subject in a recent edition of Darkroom Techniques
    so I won&#39;t belabor it.  But he demonstrated his &amp;quot;two light&amp;quot; viewing system
    and it worked.  The print, wet, looked no better than the dry print did.
    I *did* think that I saw a little more detail in some highlights in the
    dry print, but the sense of luminosity seen in the wet print was not lost 
    in the dry print.  Highlights did not look darker in the dry print than
    in the wet one.

    Get the Darkroom Techniques article.  It&#39;ll explain it all.

    BTW - I was gratified to at last find in Bruce someone else who has 
    noticed the incredible amount that FB paper swells when wet and who has 
    theorized that some of the accentuation of detail in highlights of a dry 
    print may be due to the print shrinking back to its dry size, compacting
    all the little specks of black silver. I&#39;ve measured 16x20 paper 
    to be, indeed, 16x20 when dry but 16x20.625 when wet.  That&#39;s a large
    dimensional change.

  - In addition, many of his images are composites of two negatives.  We
    watched him create a new one.  A slit canyon image where two negatives
    had interesting stuff but also boring stuff.  He combined them into
    one print (using two enlargers and easels) so well that you could
    never guess that the image was &amp;quot;manufactured&amp;quot;.  He did it in less
    than two hours &amp;quot;from scratch&amp;quot;, never having printed it before, and did so
    without benefit of a scanner or computer.  :-)

* Don Kirby demonstrated using split filtration with VC paper to print
  a difficult negative (making a great image of a wheat field with storm
  clouds above it) and also printed an abstract in rock forms which he
  selectively bleached extensively, producing a huge change in the
  final image.  I was amazed.  I&#39;d never known that you could use bleach
  to effect that great a change in a print.

* Dry mounting of prints, including fixing defects (dimples and pimples) in 
  the mounted print.

* Spotting of dust specks and etching out of black marks (from scratches on
  negatives and from dust on negatives at exposure time) on prints.

Other things that I learned:
----- ------ ---- - -------
  * Paper storage:  he removes the inner light-tight envelop and just 
    trusts the box to protect the paper from light.  Seems to work just fine.
    I find the inner envelope to be a pain and put my paper in a paper safe
    while working with it.  But this is a pain if I&#39;m switching contrast
    grades often.  I&#39;m considering trying his techinique.  After all, all I
    have to lose is a few hundred dollars worth of paper, right?  :-)

  * One of the &amp;quot;bibles&amp;quot; often cited here in rec.photo, &amp;quot;Overexposed&amp;quot;, the book
    on photo darkroom hazards, contains at least one notable error.  One of 
    their previous students was director of the USC Medical School.  The issue 
    of toxicity of selenium toner came up during that workshop and when he got 
    home he had a research team look into it.  They concluded that selenium 
    powder is, indeed, extremely dangerous if the dust is inhaled.  As we
    all knew.  But in solution it will not penetrate the skin.  Period.  
    So I&#39;ve been wearing rubber gloves when toning for no reason.  Guess I 
    should probably refrain from drinking it, though.  :-)

    Although Bruce didn&#39;t go into the details, he also said that the 
    researchers found that the book contains several blatant errors on toxicity
    (all on the side of saying that things are more dangerous than they really
    are) and that it comments on the toxicity of at least one compound which 
    just doesn&#39;t exist.

    He notes that he&#39;s found that mixing developer, stopbath and fix produces
    an excellent fertilizer.  He used to dump it on his lawn and it 
    seemed to thrive on the mixture.

    He does, now, use a &amp;quot;Silver Magnet&amp;quot; to de-silver his fixer before 
    discarding it.

  * Get the hell out of PSA before you&#39;re permanently warped.  (PSA is 
    Photographic Society of America - the umbrella organization for many
    photo clubs).  He constantly criticized me for following too many &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot;,
    as dearly espoused by the judges in PSA monthly competitions.  Especially 
    wrt composition.  He said that I needed to get the **** out of PSA before 
    the damage is too extensive.  Then said to forget it as it was already too 
    late and I need to spend some time seriously working to unlearn the 
    bullbleep.  That I seem to have a lot of rules floating around in my
    head, especialy wrt composition, and that they were limiting me.


    I have now consorted with maybe half a dozen top fine-art photographers at 
    workshops and classes.  Not one has had anything good to say about this 
    organization.  I also note that I&#39;ve not heard of any member of PSA who
    has attained the stature of any of these top fine-art photographers.  I&#39;m 
    starting to detect a trend. 

  * I, as was true for many other students, need to be more bold in the
    darkroom.  Make big changes, instead of tiny incremental changes.  Print
    with brighter whites and blacker blacks (I.e. more contrast.)  They 
    thought that many of my prints were muddy and liked them more when I 
    reprinted them during the darkroom sessions to have far more contrast.  
    Personally I think that they&#39;re somewhat too contrasty, but I 
    see their point.   I can see some major re-interpreting in the immediate 
    future.

  * Bruce devotes a lot of time to questioning why we make photographs.  In 
    particular, before the critique each student was required to explain what
    he&#39;s trying to accomplish with his photographs.  Make an &amp;quot;artists
    statement&amp;quot;.  Then he might ask questions like:  &amp;quot;And what is this 
    photograph trying to say?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Hmmm.  It doesn&#39;t really say that to me.  
    Why?  What are you trying to tell me about this subject?&amp;quot;

    The critique lasted as long as necessary to discuss each student&#39;s work in
    as much depth as required.  There was no rush.  With 12 students, there
    were 16 hours devoted to the critique.  No sense of being rushed to get
    through.  Each student had the undivided attention of both instructors.
    I&#39;ve been to workshops where the &amp;quot;critique&amp;quot; took place in a three hour
    period for all 15 students.  And was virtually useless.  This was the
    opposite.  Not necessarily completely comfortable but highly beneficial.

    I learned, maybe more than anything else in this workshop, that I need
    to work on the philosophy of my photography.  I don&#39;t think that I can
    grow much more just by exposing film and making prints.  I need to 
    understand, and to be able to verbalize, just what it is that excites me
    and how and what I want to communicate about it to the viewer.  This
    is very difficult for me but I&#39;m now convinced that I must work on it.

    One guy was asking Bruce what was wrong that he couldn&#39;t make an
    exciting print from a particular negative.  Bruce kept asking him what
    it was that he liked about the scene and what he was trying to 
    communicate about it.  The guy couldn&#39;t articulate it and was frustrated
    because Bruce wouldn&#39;t say &amp;quot;burn here and dodge there&amp;quot;.  Bruce maintained
    that the reason that he couldn&#39;t make an interesting print was because
    he didn&#39;t know why he was printing it and the student kept saying
    &amp;quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about composition, I want to talk about the
    technicalities.&amp;quot;  Interesting conversation.

    During my &amp;quot;artists statement&amp;quot; I said, rather apologetically, that I was a 
    little embarrassed by my photos as everyone else&#39;s had been a relative 
    homogeneous body of work whereas mine were &amp;quot;all over the map&amp;quot; - a still 
    life, interior architectural, &amp;quot;grand vista&amp;quot;, detail of a pond and 
    grasses, ...  Bruce asked first what was wrong with that? (I suspect
    that he detected a &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot;) and then said that he thought that there was 
    more commonality than I was recognizing.  He didn&#39;t explicitly state what 
    it was, but I have a sense that he&#39;s right.  And I think that I need to 
    figure out what it is in order to continue to grow.  I will.

  * If you don&#39;t care about your subject then you&#39;ll never make an interesting
    photo of it.  I&#39;ve been coming to this realization on my own for a while
    but we talked about it considerably.  I have now completely stopped 
    &amp;quot;exposing film because I&#39;m here, even though I&#39;m not really finding 
    anything super interesting&amp;quot;.  I realized that Bruce and Don are
    intensely involved with everything that they photograph and it shows
    in their prints.  I think that I must feel the same or there&#39;s no point
    to bothering.  As I said, I was tending in this direction before the
    workshop but this crystallized things for me.

  * Shun rules!  Avoid rules!  Break rules!  Don&#39;t do rules!  Down with rules!
    Don&#39;t justify your compositional choices by citing rules!  We don&#39;t *like* 
    rules!

  * Bruce prices his prints based on size, although he thinks that this is
    silly.  He does so because the world expects it.  But he only prints 
    each image at one size, the size which he thinks &amp;quot;works&amp;quot; best for that
    image.  He considers choice of image size to be an integral part of the 
    creative process.  

    He dislikes the &amp;quot;limited edition&amp;quot; concept and considers his bowing to the 
    demands of galleries and starting a few limited editions to have been a 
    really big mistake.

There was much, much more to be learned in this class and from these 
people.  However, by no means do I think that I&#39;ve &amp;quot;gone to the mountain and 
come down with the commandments&amp;quot;.  Nor would Bruce or Don want students to feel
that way.  What I&#39;ve learned is a little bit about how two extraordinary 
photographers work, think and feel and now I can incorporate these into
my own way of working as works best for me.  This is what they want the
students to do.  This workshop was an outstanding opportunity for growth and 
I cannot recommend it too highly.

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-review-by-barry-sherman&#34;&gt;A review by Barry Sherman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m of very mixed minds regarding the Bender kit. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely cheap
and definitely light. Both good things! But I think that there are some
very serious down-sides. Not too long ago the Tachihara cost about \$450
while it cost about \$250 all told to build the Bender kit and I&amp;rsquo;d have
recommended buying the Tachihara unless one absolutely required longer
bellows extension than it can provide or simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t scrape up the
extra \$200. Nowadays the Tachihara is up to something like \$600 or
\$650 and \$400 is a bigger jump in the price so I&amp;rsquo;d be a little more
hesitant about recommending it over the Bender. So. What I like about
the Bender:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cheap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not bad to build. I have a lot of woodworking experience and
that helped, but I&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt that someone with none could build
one. They&amp;rsquo;d have to think about things a little more, but it&amp;rsquo;s
doable. I think that I spent around 30 hours building mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can have unlimited bellows extension. The &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; is
something like 16 inches but the bellows will allow about 22 inches
and you can buy a longer monorail for just a very few dollars as
it&amp;rsquo;s just a piece of square aluminum extrusion. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to cut one
off shorter, also, to suit your needs. If you wanted *really* long
bellows extension, Jay Bender would be happy to supply a really long
bellows and monorail and there you have it. Probably cost less than
\$100, compared to the \$150 for an extension monorail plus \$500
for an extension bellows that I&amp;rsquo;d have to spend for my Arca Swiss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessories are cheap. The kit for the bag bellows cost around \$30.
I spent \$500 buying a leather wide-angle (not a bag) for my Arca
Swiss. It works wonderfully, never folding itself into the image
area like the Bender one does. Bur a savings of \$470 is not to be
sneered at. (Arca Swiss also makes a synthetic wide angle bellows
for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that price but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t locate one when I got the camera
and, at that time, there was no U.S. distributor for them so I took
what I could get. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve absorbed the shock of the price I
really love the bellows.) When I found that I was using more
movements with my 210mm lens than the standard bellows could
accomodate, Jay Bender made a special bag bellows kit for an
enormous one that would accomodate extreme movements and charged
\$35 for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the parts are less robust than I&amp;rsquo;d prefer. There are three
&amp;ldquo;monorail riders&amp;rdquo;. Two attach the front and rear standards while the
third has the screw hole for attaching to a tripod and attaches the
monorail to the tripod head. I think that this one piece is grossly
too weak. I accidentally left the fore-and-aft lock on the pan head
too loose and the head/camera rotated forward until it stopped
abruptly at the end of its travel. The piece of wood shattered,
depositing the rest of the camera on the ground 6 inches away from a
mountain river in full spring flood. A friend with a machine shop
fabricated replacement monorail riders from Delrin, a space-age
plastic that&amp;rsquo;s pretty well indestructable. But at normal machine
shop rates of \$50 per hour, it would have cost me several hundred
dollars for the job had I not had friends do it free. In all
honesty, though, I have to say that I&amp;rsquo;m the only person who I&amp;rsquo;ve
heard of having this trouble. I also found that if I inserted a
heavy Polaroid 545 holder, the rear standard kind of sagged under
the weight. I had to reinforce part of it to eliminate the sagging.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monorail riders, if fitted so as to be loose enough to slide
back and forth for focusing, have a tendency to rotate just a little
when you lock them in place after focusing. You turn a clamping knob
and the torsion of turning it makes the rider rotate just a little
in a fore-and aft direction wrt the monorail and around the clamping
bolt. This is irritating but not terrible as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually you&amp;rsquo;re focusing partway into the scene instead of on one
specific object so a little slop isn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get used to it and learn to compensate when focusing so that
it rotates into exactly the right spot when you clamp it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With practice you can minimize the movement anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a big thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s irritating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one lock knob for both shift and swing movements. Not a big
deal for most outdoor landscape photographers. But if you&amp;rsquo;re using
both shift and swing, then it can be irritating. First you set the
back to be parallel to the facade of the building that you&amp;rsquo;re
photographing. Now you swing the front to be parallel to the back.
But swinging the front changes where the camera lens is pointing so
you need to shift one of the standards a little to re-frame the
scene. But when you loosen the knob to do the shift you lose the
shift that you just painstakingly set using the loupe on the ground
glass. The solution is to only set the front swing roughly at first,
not bothering with the loupe. Then set the shift to get proper
framing. Then use the loupe to fine-tune the swing. Not a big thing,
but it&amp;rsquo;s irritating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had occasional troubles with light leaks developing around the
perimeter of the bellows. Care must be taken when changing bellows
to ensure that the little &amp;lsquo;L&amp;rsquo; screws that hold the bellows in place
are clamping firmly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I think that the Bender is a fully usable camera and I&amp;rsquo;ve taken some
of my very best, and best sellling, photos with it. But I do prefer the
convenience of a real store-boughten camera. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept it and take it on
trips to carry for longer walks, but it has to be a fairly lengthy or
strenuous hike before I&amp;rsquo;ll abandon the convenience of the Arca Swiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;review-by-geoff-allen&#34;&gt;Review by Geoff Allen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: The only other 4x5 camera I&amp;rsquo;ve used is a Linhof
Technikardan, which is an amazingly cool camera, but costs a couple
orders of magnitude more than the Bender. I&amp;rsquo;ve never used a field camera
or a monstrous studio camera. You might need to take such things into
consideration as you read this. Also, I have no connection whatsoever
with Bender Photographic, other than as a very satisfied customer. As I
see it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great camera and loads of fun. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend loads of
money for a view camera if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a few weeks of time available. (It
took me a year to build mine, but I actually only spent about three
weeks of actual effort.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movements limited only by lens coverage. You can very easily reach the
limits of most any lens with this camera, since the only physical
restriction on tilts and swings is the bellows, and rises and shifts are
a couple of inches in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light. The Bender is half the weight of the Technikardan. This should be
an important consideration when I&amp;rsquo;m trudging high in the Tetons. A three
pound camera vs. a six pound camera is no contest when one is climbing a
mountain. :\^)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You build it yourself. Pride of ownership. It&amp;rsquo;s loads of fun to tell
people you built a camera and see what reactions you get! Chances are
you&amp;rsquo;ll be the first in your neighborhood to do this! Some folks might
consider the need to build the camera a con, of course. :\^)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attractive. I think my Bender is more attractive than donl&amp;rsquo;s
Technikardan, and I&amp;rsquo;ve told him so. :\^)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to build it. Can also be considered a pro. :\^)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friction focusing only. I&amp;rsquo;ve had no problems with this, though. Use a
loupe and stop down to f/32 or so and you&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little brass l-screws are used to hold the lensboard, back, and bellows
in place. I replaced them all. On my camera, I hold the lensboard and
bellows in place with some plastic window screen retainer clips. Lots
nicer. And for the back, I found some catch locks that hold it more
securely than I think the l-screws would have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movements aren&amp;rsquo;t ``calibrated.&amp;rdquo; But if you care about such things,
there&amp;rsquo;s nothing preventing you from marking appropriate calibrations on
the standard yourself. (There are levels for the back provided with the
kit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get really tight when using a 90mm lens. With a 90mm lens, the
bag bellows is essential, as the standards are about as close together
as they can physically get. With a 135mm lens, I find I still need the
bag bellows. At 210mm, I can use the regular bellows. For anything
shorter than 90mm, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;d need to rig up a recessed lens board.
So, if you&amp;rsquo;ve been drooling over that 58mm Super Angulon, you&amp;rsquo;d better
drool over another camera to go with it. ;\^)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;usage-notes&#34;&gt;Usage notes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For using my camera, I leave the monorail on the tripod. This provides
the next best thing to a quick release (maybe even better, because you
can hold the camera with two hands while putting it on the tripod). When
taking a picture, I just haul the camera out of my carrying bag and
slide one standard onto the monorail on either side of the tripod mount.
For the 90mm, both standards have to go on the same side of the tripod
mount, because you can&amp;rsquo;t get them close enough otherwise. I honestly
can&amp;rsquo;t remember which way I configure things for the 135mm lens. I think
it&amp;rsquo;s the same as the 90mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing the camera from the monorail also has the advantage of making
the camera fit into a carrying bag more easily. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not as
compact as a Technikardan, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep both standards all the way down in their rise/fall adjustments
for their ``zero&amp;rdquo; position. This keeps the camera a little more
compact without sacrificing any movements, since front fall can simply
be accomplished by back rise. This means one less movement to zero when
you set the camera up (well, actually, two movements, I suppose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-else-you-d-need-besides-the-camera&#34;&gt;What else you&amp;rsquo;d need besides the camera&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Bender is tempting as a low-cost way of getting into large
format photography, you should realize that the couple of hundred
dollars you&amp;rsquo;ll spend for the camera is the beginning, not the end, of
your capital outlay. Besides the camera, you&amp;rsquo;ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Film holders &amp;ndash; You&amp;rsquo;ll use a lot less film when shooting 4x5, but I&amp;rsquo;d
still recommend having several film holders around. Maybe 5 as a
minimum. How many you want is a trade-off between how often you&amp;rsquo;re
willing to reload, how many different kinds of film you want available,
and how much you&amp;rsquo;re willing to carry. (Large format film holders hold
two sheets of film per holder.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lens(es) &amp;ndash; Here&amp;rsquo;s where you&amp;rsquo;ll spend the money. I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough
about older designs to make any recommendations, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for
used lens deals. In newer models, Schneider, Rodenstock and Nikon are
all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loupe &amp;ndash; perhaps somewhat optional, but extremely helpful for getting
the focus right on. Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s a loupe that works with a ground
glass, since the image is a few mm from the end of the loupe, due to the
thickness of the glass. A loupe designed for viewing slides won&amp;rsquo;t work,
unless you can adjust the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A carrying bag for everything. You might try a generic daypack in the
\$100 range, rather than a \$400-500 ``photo&amp;rdquo; backpack. I use a
generic pack without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bag Bellows &amp;ndash; you almost certainly want to buy this when you buy the
camera kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meter &amp;ndash; remember, this is a truly mechanical camera; there&amp;rsquo;s no meter.
You&amp;rsquo;ll have to supply your own. Any handheld meter you know how to use
will work fine. If you want to get into spot metering, check out Ansel
Adams&amp;rsquo; book, _The_Negative_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing &amp;ndash; this could be where the problem lies. Your options
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A custom lab that will develop/print the film for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A friend with a darkroom and 4x5 enlarger you can borrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rental darkroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your own darkroom and 4x5 enlarger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing the film isn&amp;rsquo;t too big a deal. You can use the Jobo reels and
tanks designed for 4x5 film with or without a Jobo processor. Phil Davis
also markets his ``BTZS&amp;rdquo; developing tubes that I&amp;rsquo;ve read fairly good
things about. For printing anything, though, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need a 4x5
enlarger (you could contact print as a start). But you could just shoot
chrome film for a while to get used to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly recommend the Bender camera. You&amp;rsquo;ll trade some slick
features of something like a Technikardan for a lighter, though more
bulky, camera. I really found little practical difference in using the
Bender or a Technikardan. The pictures I took with donl&amp;rsquo;s Technikardan
and my Bender are of equal quality. Building it is fun (and I have no
experience in woodworking, so if I can do it, anyone can) &amp;ndash; just go
slowly and methodically and everything will be all right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;additional-info&#34;&gt;Additional info&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are comments from others that I&amp;rsquo;ve collected. I&amp;rsquo;ve occasionally
added comments enclosed in square brackets &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;[]&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; and signed with
my initials, &amp;lsquo;gwa&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

Organization: Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA

A couple of people sent me email asking for more information about the
Bender view camera kit i mentioned, one of them suggesting a general
posting might be of interest.  I talk too much, so this is rather long;
my apologies to those who are not interested.

The 4x5 kit is about $150, the 8x10 is about $250.  The primary
difference, other than size, is that the 4x5 has interchangeable
bellows (because you typically need a bag bellows with short lenses in
4x5, but not in 8x10), and more movements on the rear standard (i
believe it&#39;s built more like the front standard, where the 8x10 has
tilt and swing only, with no shift or rise).

[The prices are now $190 and $290.  The front and rear standards on the
4x5 are basically identical, except the rear standard is a little wider.
You have the same movements available on both standards. -- gwa]

It&#39;s all made of cherry.  You receive, essentially, a rather small box
full of sticks and other parts (hardware, ground glass, bellows,
etc.).  Complex wood parts are glued up out of simple rectangular
pieces, rather than having been shaped in a more sophisticated way at
the factory.  This basic principle keeps the production simple (i.e.
inexpensive), but means you have to do some fancy gluing and clamping
to get it built.  I am not a woodworker, though i know the basics.  I
had no trouble building the kit, except for one (count them, 1)
dimension that didn&#39;t quite work out quite right on the back of the
8x10 (which is built differently than the 4x5 so is a non-issue
there).  Something along the lines of &amp;quot;if this is here, and that goes
there, then this overhang is not sufficient to glue that thing to.&amp;quot;
Nothing serious; a little cleverness makes everything fit.

[I had no problems with the 4x5, and I know nothing about woodworking!
-- gwa]

Start with as many C-clamps as you can find.  I believe i had 16 -- 8
little ones and 8 big ones.  I used little patches of cut up mat board
as pads to keep the clamps from marring the wood.  If you have lots of
clamps, you can let one glued and clamped assembly dry while you&#39;re
working on the next.

[I second the motion on clamps.  If you can get some of those clamps
which hold a corner, they will be quite useful as well. -- gwa]

I used a palm sander to round off all of the corners.  I think it makes
it look a LOT better than the simple, square-edged version pictured in
the ad.  I also stained it dark mahogany before varnishing.  Finishing,
though, is entirely your option.  It can be as simple as a little oil.

[I left mine square, and stained it a golden oak.  Very attractive.  I
used some spray-on stain which requires no wiping.  Very convenient for
all those nooks and crannies.  -- gwa]

Gluing the bellows on the 8x10 was something i approached with fear and
trepidation, because it is this big old floppy thing that you can&#39;t get
a hold of and won&#39;t cooperate, and the dimensions of the flap on either
end don&#39;t really match size of the wooden frame they are supposed to be
glued to.  I called Bender and we chatted for a bit, during which time
he told me it looks harder than it is -- just give it a shot, it will
be fine.  So i did, using some (non-from-the-kit) angle and straight
brackets to help hold things together as i worked my way around.  It
was a little messy, with epoxy oozing out here and there, but otherwise
not bad.

[The 4x5 bellows is no big deal. -- gwa]

The design is such that certain parts (lens board, removeable back,
etc.) are held on by these little brass screw L-pins.  I thought they
looked a little weak; i ended up making changes such that i didn&#39;t need
them.  The given lens board, which is 6x6 i believe, is a piece of
black acrylic sheet.  Additional boards are available (or make your
own), and you use one per lens, as usual with view cameras.  The design
says that you twist the L pins to catch the edges and hold everything
in place.  I made a lens board from a heavier sheet of black acrylic
and a few additional pieces, using a Bridgeport mill, that serves only
to accept my Linhof Technikarden lens boards, which are more like 4x4,
thus permitting me to swap lenses between cameras when appropriate.
The rear film holder frame was also designed to be held on with the
L-pins.  It must be removable so that you can orient the film
vertically or horizontally as appropriate.  Rather than use the pins, i
drilled a hole in each corner of it, and put studs in the back of the
camera that poke through the holes, with a little knob on each one.  I
used 1/4&amp;quot; studs, because all of the other studs in the camera are 1/4&amp;quot;,
and they were MUCH too large and the holes ended up being rather
crude.  If i were to do it again, i would use rather small screw-in
studs to hold the back on.  They must be carefully placed so that the
back fits both vertically and horizontally over the same studs, i.e.
they must be really square.

[Some catch locks can do the job of holding the back in place also. 
Poke around in the fastener section of your favorite hardware store and
see what they&#39;ve got that looks good. -- gwa]

There were other wire pins used as pivots here and there; i replaced
them with heavier brass rod, because i like to over-engineer
everything.

They suggest gluing the various clamping studs into their respective
knobs, and screwing them into the T-nuts embedded in the parts of the
camera.  I decided i would rather strip the threads in the knob than in
the T-nuts, because the knob can be replaced, but the T-nut can&#39;t.  You
can&#39;t always glue the studs into the T-nuts because then you can&#39;t get
the camera apart if you ever need to, because of the way it is
assembled.  Usually, a healthy twist on the stud will drive it home in
the T-nut where it runs into the backing piece of wood, and it will
stay there as you loosen and tighten the knob.

[I didn&#39;t glue any of mine, and it seems to have made no difference. --gwa]

The camera focuses by loosening a clamp and sliding the front standard
back and forth on the rail, which is a 1x1 square aluminum tube.  With
the long lenses used on an 8x10, i found it a bit difficult to reach
when standing behind the camera and looking at the ground glass.  The
rear standard of the 8x10 has a pivot in the middle (at the base), and
studs with knobs running in arced slots at the left and right to clamp
it in place as you do your swings.  I left out the pivot, and enlarged
the slots a bit so the whole rear standard could actually be moved
forward and backward an inch or so, as well as swinging as necessary.
This gives me an inch or so of focusing range at the rear standard,
right there in front of me, so i don&#39;t have to reach out around to the
front of the camera when tuning the focus.  It gets a bit difficult to
reach all the way up there when using a 20&amp;quot; lens!  Standing behind the
camera, you just can&#39;t reach.  I&#39;m not sure how the 4x5 is set up;
hopefully, you can slide the rear standard and focus there.

[Yep.  Both standards slide easily.  I generally rough-focus by moving
the front and fine-focus by moving the back.  -- gwa]

I don&#39;t think there were any other major points; all in all it was
pretty fun to build, and is actually quite easy to use.

I picked up an old Turner-Reich triple convertible, 300-500-600mm focal
lengths, f/7, in an old slow shutter that i had to recalibrate (1/2,
1/4, 1/8, 1/12, and 1/30 second, with the all-important B and T
settings!).  The front and rear parts of the lens unscrew; using both
of them gives you a 12&amp;quot; (300mm) lens, which is equivalent to 150mm in
4x5, and is sort of normal, but actually slightly wide.  Using one or
the other have alone, behind the shutter, gives you 500 or 600mm focal
length, with significantly reduced image quality, which means you&#39;d
better stop way down if you expect a decent image.  Actually not a
terrific lens, but it was sort of cheap, which is the general idea.
Hindsight says i should have gotten a better 300mm lens and forgotten
about this convertible stuff.  For 4x5, you probably want to start with
a 210, maybe a 150.  There are probably lots of cheap 150&#39;s out there,
so for not TOO terribly much money, you can get started in 4x5.  Then
if you are clever, you can turn it into an enlarger by finding a way to
fasten a cold-light source on the back, behind or instead of the ground
glass, with some sort of negative carrier.  I think Bender might be
working on something like that; ask them.

I made several phone calls, and the same guy always answered the phone,
who i suspect might be Mr. Bender himself, and he was always nice and
friendly and sort of got to know who i was, so that by the time i
called him from Port Angeles, Washington, in the middle of my trip,
moaning about breaking the ground glass and needing another one, he
sort of knew who i was.  I made a cover for the ground glass out of
acrylic sheet.  It fastens quickly over the back of the camera, and is
spaced out from the glass about 1/2&amp;quot;.  Highly recommended.

&amp;gt; Thanks for the very informative posting, Don. You&#39;ve piqued my interest.
&amp;gt; I&#39;m wondering about some of the statistics for these cameras. Like, max
&amp;gt; bellows draw, weight, and how compact are they when closed up. Would you
&amp;gt; consider (gasp) backpacking the 8x10?

[I would take mine!  Of course, it&#39;s only 4x5. :^) -- gwa]

I have no doubt that it could be made to fit in a back pack; you will need
to fashion a cover for the ground glass.  If you remove the monorail (which
can be accomplished by loosening a couple of knobs and pulling it out), the
bellows can be compressed all the way down, and everything sort of fits
together pretty well.  I would consider it, yes, though i can&#39;t say for
sure how it would work out!  I&#39;ve been carrying it around in a canvas bag.

[A very cumbersome-looking canvas bag, I might add.  As donl has it set
up now, he wouldn&#39;t want to take it more than a few feet from the car.
:^) -- gwa]

The overall package is smaller than my 4x5 outfit; i have four 8x10 holders,
and only one lens, so there isn&#39;t much else to carry.  You tend to run lean
on holders, because they&#39;re (gasp) $40 each, new.  Get used ones.  Don&#39;t
buy very many.  Don&#39;t make exposures you aren&#39;t sure are going to be
printable.  Etc. etc. etc.  It&#39;s a time-and-effort versus money tradeoff
to load film holders a little more often!

The 4x5 kit:

    $150, 3 lbs., 10x10x4 (folded)

[Now $189.50, as noted above. -- gwa]

    rise and fall at both ends: 2 3/4&amp;quot;

[Or, as I use it, rise at both ends: 5 1/2&amp;quot; -- gwa]

    tilts and swings at both ends: 45 degrees

[The stats lie.  Physically, both of these movements are limited only by
the bellows.  Without the bellows you can swing them all the way around. 
I think that&#39;s more than 45 degrees. :^)  The only real limitation on
your movements with this camera is the coverage of the lens, and that&#39;s
what really matters anyway. -- gwa]

    front shift 3&amp;quot;, rear 4&amp;quot;.
    extension: 3&amp;quot; minimum, 22&amp;quot; maximum.

[Here&#39;s where you see the problem with short lenses.  90mm is only 3.5
inches.  You&#39;re just about as short as you can get when using a 90. -- gwa]

    interchangeable bellows; optional bag bellows.
    Interchangeable lens board.  Back rotates to vertical or horizontal.

    Cherry wood with little bits of hardware here and there.  All
    movements, including focusing, are friction locks via knobs on
    1/4-20 studs.

    The rail is a simple 1x1 square aluminum tube; appropriate lengths
    are easy to make.

The 8x10 kit:

    $250, 6 lbs., sort of big but folds up reasonably well.

[Now $289.50. -- gwa]

    rise and fall at front: 2 3/4&amp;quot;, none at the rear.
    front swings and tilts: 45 degrees
    rear swing 12 degrees, tilt 18 degrees.
    front shift 4&amp;quot;, none at rear.

    Non-interchangeable bellows (not necessary in 8x10).

    Other features the same as as the 4x5.

All swing and tilt angles are plus-or-minus.

&amp;gt;Question:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;How rigid are they? 
[Description of windy visit to Point Lobos]
&amp;gt;He was very upset by the wind.  He showed me how the camera was 
&amp;gt;flopping in the wind.  It was clearly unusable.  I had no problem with 
&amp;gt;my rigid bodied 35mm.  He said that he doubted that he would have had a
&amp;gt;problem were he using his Toya view camera.  But the floppiness of the 
&amp;gt;field camera was very disconcerting.

Well, I haven&#39;t had it out in any major winds (though we get them here,
that&#39;s for sure), but I don&#39;t think the camera would be flopping in the
wind.  Of course, if there&#39;s any vegetation in the scene, you don&#39;t want
to be using large format anyway!

The camera does seem to ``give&#39;&#39; a little when I insert a film holder,
but it stays in focus, so it&#39;s obviously not slipping any.

A bigger hazard in a heavy wind might be that the camera is so light,
yet so big.  The wind may try to carry it off.  I don&#39;t know if that
would become a problem or not.

&amp;gt;I&#39;m hoping to start with large format in the next year or so and
&amp;gt;am considering a Bender kit as a starter. 

[Barry has since caved in to the temptation of that 20 square-inch piece
of film, as you may know.  He started with another camera, and has since
bought a Bender, for the weight savings.  Welcome to the club, Barry! --gwa]

&amp;gt;But somehow the
&amp;gt;friction locks on the Benders just don&#39;t look as if they would
&amp;gt;produce a really rigid assembly.  What does experience show?

I&#39;d say it locks up just fine.  The friction locks, you probably know,
are just screws.  I tighten them up pretty snugly and everything holds
together just fine.  In fact, when playing with tilts (which are held by
two screws) I usually just tighten one and leave the other loose.  This
allows me to use one hand to adjust the tilt and one to man the lock. 
Tightening down one side seems to hold it pretty well.  Of course, once
I decide everything is how I want it, I lock the other one as well. 
Then check the focus again, just to be sure. 

I haven&#39;t had any problems yet.

Another thing I wondered about the friction locks was focusing.  I
wondered how close I&#39;d be able to get focusing without a geared focusing
movement.  The answer is, ``Quite well, thank you.&#39;&#39; I do my rough focus
with the front standard and fine focus with the rear standard, and am
rather impressed with how easy it is to move the standard the tiny
little bit required to get the focus right where you want it.  I&#39;d
definitely recommend a little extra care when building the monorail
riders, which are the first parts in the instruction book.  There&#39;s a
bit of extra wood in them, which you sand away.  If you don&#39;t sand
enough, they&#39;ll be loose; if you sand too much, they&#39;ll be tight. 
Either way, focusing will be more difficult.

[I&#39;m posting this for Steve. -- donl]

-----

For the past two months, I&#39;ve been building a Bender 4x5 camera.
Given the interest in 4x5, and specifically Bender cameras, evidenced
by recent rec.photo traffic, I decided to write about my kit-building
experiences.

donl@sgi.com has graciously offered to post these articles for me;
I don&#39;t have posting ability to this group anymore (and only limited access
to read it). Send comments DIRECTLY TO ME at the Email address (way) below.

PART 1 (starts with lots of drivel about me, skip forward if you&#39;re bored):

My background:

My career is as a software engineer, but I&#39;ve been involved professionally
in photography for about eight years. My forte is atypical portraits, more
intense than typical &amp;quot;glamour/fashion&amp;quot; work, but along those lines (I tend
toward saturated colors and hard lighting, with unusual posing/props.)
I&#39;ve done some product shots, some &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; coverage, and have made one 
magazine cover. Most of my work has been done in small/medium format.
I print my own B/W and color, and process my own B/W film. It&#39;s 
more cost-effective for me to run roll film through a local minilab.

Why 4x5?

As indicated above, I don&#39;t do this full-time. The professional aspect
is really intended to finance my equipment needs for personal photography.
Of course, I still have to pay taxes on it :-(.  My personal interest is
&amp;quot;fine art&amp;quot; photography, specifically landscapes, macro flowers, and
&amp;quot;set&amp;quot; pieces. 4x5 or larger is the preferred format for this type of work.

Why a Bender kit?

It&#39;s cheap. No, actually, that&#39;s just part of it. I enjoy building things,
and I wanted a camera I could backpack with, without being overly concerned
about knocking it around. At $200.00, the Bender fits the bill. I dropped 
the serious bucks on a spotmeter and a Nikkor lense. When you
couple that with film holders, large format darkroom gear (used), and
assorted bits, minimizing costs becomes a consideration. Who knows, maybe
I&#39;ll hate large format :-). Bender kits have gotten mostly good reviews,
both on the net and in the photo media.

The Kit:

The kit is composed of an unmounted bellows, assorted hardware, a ground
glass, and, as donl accurately describes it: &amp;quot;a rather small box
full of sticks&amp;quot; (nicely machined sticks).

Features:

The Bender is basically a wooden monorail camera. It has full tilts and
swings, and substantial rise/fall and lateral shifts. Your lense coverage
is probably the limiting factor here. All movements and focus are friction
lock. There are no scales on any of the movements, but you could add them
if you really care. The back holder has two small leveling vials; front/
back, and left/right. All wooden parts are unfinished cherry. You finish
the camera however you like. The removeable parts (lensboard, back, bellows
frames) are held on with moveable &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; screws. Some people (including me)
consider this a mis-feature... however, Jay Bender correctly points out that
they DO work, and they keep the kit cost down. Most of us complainers :-)
changed these to something else, which is possible with a kit. 

Recent changes in the kit:

Bender does, on occasion, upgrade the kit based on owner feedback. The 
following improvements were made as of August 15, 1992. (Newer manuals 
should be current now; I got an old manual and a Errata/Changes sheet).
Note: most of this is meaningless if you haven&#39;t already built the kit;
I&#39;m describing it for the benefit of owners of previous renditions...

1) The groundglass holder is now attached to the back differently. The
spring wires now mount into the back at the bottom at a single point each.
Looking from the back, the wires run vertically, with inward-turning
right angles at the MIDDLE of the groundglass holder, which fit into a
small block attached to the groundglass holder. The wires extend down
to the bottom piece of the back, and turn a right angle INTO the back
(along your line of sight). About a half-inch above this turn, a small
notched block is screwed into the side piece of the back to hold the
wire down and provide the &amp;quot;springy&amp;quot;-ness. (This is as opposed to the older
style which mounted to the back in the center sides, and hooked to four
L-screws mounted horizontally into the groundglass holder).

2) Most (all?) glued-together rectangles now have screws also at the
joints.

3) The groundglass holder now has a wider part 16 on the side where the
film holder is inserted. This is done to allow you to file the underside
to a slope, to act as a combination handle and guide for film holder
insertion.

4) (I&#39;m not sure this is new) Washers are now supplied to fit between
the rise/fall locks and the frames, and between the frames and back
holder/lensboard holder (ie - between all sliding parts except the 
frames and monorail sliders).

What you need to build it:

As several previous posts have mentioned: LOTS of clamps. I bought
four twelve-inch bar clamps, and four three-inch C-clamps. If you&#39;re
really gung-ho, get more than this. Each major assembly typically requires
four clamps to hold it together. I found that each major assembly took
about all the time I had or wanted to spare on any given evening.
In addition, you need multiple sheets of sandpaper in various grades
(I used 100, 150, and 220 grit). A one-quarter-inch wood file is useful
in a few instances. The kit is assembled with brass screws and carpenter&#39;s
glue (the yellow stuff). The bellows is mounted to the bellows frames
with contact cement. Contact cement is applied to the joining surfaces,
then allowed to dry (mostly). The two parts can then be loosely positioned
without sticking together (much), then pressed together for a secure fit.

C-clamps aren&#39;t necessarily the best choice here, because they aren&#39;t
designed to clamp a narrow thing while it&#39;s lying on a flat surface
(which seems to be the majority of the kit building). The clamps tend to
want to shear off of the part being held, because the pressure isn&#39;t
centered in the jaws. An easy solution to this is to cut a board slightly
narrower than the assembly you wish to clamp, put the board on the table,
lay the assembly on that so that the to-be-clamped edges slightly overhang,
then clamp the overhanging edges. Someone (geoff?) mentioned using corner-
clamps. In my experience, corner-clamps are designed to clamp from within
the frame being glued. The majority of the kit frames don&#39;t have sufficient
interior clearance for the clamps to fit.

Well, that&#39;s enough for now (too much?). I&#39;ll describe my luck building
the sub-assemblies in future posts. Let me know if I&#39;m giving too much or
not enough information.

Here are my opinions about the bender kit. I did mail these to people who
requested it. But since this thread appeared I felt it would be appropriate
here too. Most of the details about the kit have been mentioned by steve
(through donl&#39;s posting), so I am ignoring those aspects of the kit
building. I would however like to mention here that till about a week back I
was not fully aware of the use of the spring loaded back, not having  used
any other large format camera. My procedure for loading a film holder on the
back was to remove the ground glass holder from the spring, lay it down on
the ground or the camera bag, mount the film holder, take the shot, remove
the film holder and reinsert the ground glass holder.  It was very recently
that as I was going   through the zone VI catalog that I saw a photograph of
their view camera with the caption &amp;quot;Easy swing out bailing arm for the
ground glass&amp;quot;. That was when the THING struck me. I have, all this time,
been expending unnecessary effort on inserting the film holder. I  have 
now started loading the film holder the way it should have been done in the
first place.

This has ofcourse led to an improvement in the time to shoot (see comments
below) by about 5 to 10 percent. 

######################################################################

Experiences about the large format per se:

1) I love the image resolution and tonal/color gradation available.

2) I hate (to some extent) the time it takes to  take a shot and the
weight of the equipment that I have to lug around if I am planning on
shooting anywhere a bit farther from my car. (In my case, I do not own a
car so all the travelling is by bus and walk. I wish I could save enough
money to buy a used car -:). Other things that irk me (they are what one 
terms occupational hazards) are the fact that since I do not have a changing
bag with me at present, I have to do all the film loading/unloading at
night. In other words, I have to plan every shoot at least one day
in advance. In the next few months I plan on buying a changing room from
Calumet.




**************************************************************************

Accessories that I feel one should have for doing large format
photography:


1) A magnifying glass/slide viewer. I use my 8x agfa slide viewer to
focus the image on the ground glass. I can somehow manage because I have
20/20 vision, but if your eyesight is not so good, I would recommend one
of the slightly more expensive ones such as the CALUMET viewer that sells
for about $40.

2) A spot meter. You lose the fun in working with large format if you are
not able to analyze an image before taking a photograph of it. This is
not a big problem with roll film since one can afford to bracket.

3) I have been using a jacket as a focussing cloth. But I would still
prefer to have a regular cloth. 

4) A spirit level of some sort if you intend doing a lot of architectural
shots. The bender kit comes with two spirit levels that you glue to the
rear standards. Besides, my tripod head also has two spirit levels.

5) Other odds and ends such as lens cleaner/dust remover/brush (these are 
a must for large format). The brush can also be used for cleaning the backs
before inserting them.


**************************************************************************


The tools/consumables which IMHO one MUST have to build the Bender 4x5 kit:

1) A Drill - electrical or hand powered. The drill bits needed are 3/32&amp;quot;,
1/8&amp;quot; (or 7/64).
*** I purchased an electric drill for two dollars at a local yard sale. **

[A drill press is best if you have or can buy/borrow one. --gwa]

2) A couple of screw drivers with 3mm and 5mm blades.

3) Two grades of sandpaper: 90 and 200.

4) Clamps:  
    a) Greater than 8 inches - at least one.
    b) Greater than 6 inches - at least two.
        ( One of the above can double up for both categories)
    c) 2 inch clamps -- at least 6. (very time consuming, but could be
        done with only 2)
    d) A corner clamp.

5) Scrap wood to place between the clamps and the wood surface.

[Cardboard and mat board work as well. --gwa]

6) The smallest possible container of wood glue.

7) Contact cement that hardens to the touch in a few minutes and sets in 
about an hour or two.

8) A reasonably flat piece of material (wood or any other metal).

[I used an old piece of glass. --gwa]

9) A reasonably accurate 90 degree T-square. 

9) A hammer to fix in the T-screws for the various adjustable movements.


**************************************************************************

Tools/accessories which IMO one could use to ease the working conditions
but are not critical:

1) A drum/belt sander or a sanding drum for the drill.

2) A set of good wood working chisels or wood carving knives. (these, I
felt were the single most useful junk tools that I had collected over the
last few years.)

3) Wood working stain and brushes for finishing/polishing the wood.





BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE FOLLOWING WHILE ASSEMBLING THE KIT.

a) The single most important thing IMHO is the ground glass placement. Be
extremely careful about the dimensions that the kit mentions. (The kit is
very very accurate as far as the positioning of the glass goes. How close
you get to it is very much dependent on how patient you are in measuring
distances of about 1/32 of an inch)

b) Read the assembly for the back holder at least 3 or 4 times, do a mock
set up without actually gluing the pieces together. Keep in mind the
following :

    1) The hinge (or pivot )for the back should be towards the lens board
    and not the other way (the instruction manual is a bit fuzzy about
    this). Also, the UNEVEN ledges on the inside of the back holder
    should be away from the lens, i.e. should be facing back.

[I would recommend pre-fitting ALL of the parts, not just the back
holder.  Like I said early on in all of this, go slow and careful and
everything will be all right. --gwa]

c) Be careful with the cutting instructions for the bag bellows. Take a
couple of minutes extra in cutting. I would recommend cutting a little
less than is mentioned in the manual and then adjusting as and when
necessary. 

THERE ARE SOME MORE HINTS WHICH I WOULD RATHER TELL YOU ONCE YOU BUY THE
KIT. YOU CAN SEND ME EMAIL OR CALL ME AT (513)-281-9870.


**************************************************************************


My experiences with the Bender kit:

HITS :

1) Extremely light weight to carry. AM very pleased with this feature.

2) Is very generous in terms of movements.

3) Has interchangeable bellows (though I have never used the bag
bellows).


MISSES:

1) No geared focussing (But I do not miss them so much).

2) Am not very sure about being able to use lenses shorter than 90mm.

3) The standards have some play, but since it is wood I have realized
that they spring back to normal once external pressure  is removed. You
may have to get used to this. 

** Initially you may find that once you focus the image and then tighten all 
the knobs, the image has gone out of focus. You will then have to readjust 
every thing again. After a few attempts you will get used to allowing for
such &amp;quot;plays&amp;quot; in the focussing mechanisms.   **


4) May not be possible to rent lenses for this camera since the lensboard
is not a commonly used size. I will have to look into this sometime.

4) Some of the joints that are glued do not look/feel strong mechanically. 
I had to reinforce some of them. I use plastic window screen retainers for
holding the lens board in place  -- (an excellent piece of advice from GEOFF, 
geoff@pmafire.inel.gov  . You may want to contact him about some more 
insights about the kit) -- I have two on the top  and two on the bottom 
of the lensboard holder, besides the two L screws that Mr. Bender has 
supplied. This has given me a lot of confidence in not worrying  about 
my $500 lens falling down when the front is tilted forward.

5) Though I have not had it, light leak could be a problem if the
workmanship is not good. This is not meant to discourage anyone from
trying out the kit, just that you should take that tiny little extra care
when working on the light trapping edges such as the inside of the ground
glass/film-holder holder.


*************************************************************************

It took me about a week of intensive working (with the limited amount of
time that a PhD candidate has) to assemble the kit and test out the
focus. Plan on spending additional time if you do not do your own
darkroom processing since you may take three or four days extra if your
ground glass is not at the correct distance from the lens board. The kit
has more information about this aspect.

&lt;p&gt;Whew! If you read all of this, I know a few things about you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the determination needed to build the Bender kit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the intelligence needed to build the Bender kit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are obviously interested enough in this to have read a lot of
comments from a lot of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to go for it, remember: relax, and take thinks slow and
easy. You&amp;rsquo;ll do just fine. Happy shooting! Geoff Allen&lt;/p&gt;

large format photography. The buildings don&amp;rsquo;t move, and their
vertical and horizontal lines, as well as their restricted spaces,
call for a strict control of perspective made possible only by
camera movements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;human.html&#34;&gt;The Human figure&lt;/a&gt;. Although the large format camera is

&lt;p&gt;Inside QT Luong&amp;rsquo;s general-purpose large format camera bag&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;inside-qt-luong-s-general-purpose-large-format-camera-bag&#34;&gt;Inside QT Luong&amp;rsquo;s general-purpose large format camera bag&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary: Details with pictures the contents of QT Luong&amp;rsquo;s 5x7/35mm
general-purpose camera bag, and explains some of the reasons behind
equipment choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.terragalleria.com/&#34;&gt;Q.-Tuan Luong&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lflf.surge.sh/&#34;&gt;largeformatphotography.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article describes the gear I carry in my general-purpose
large-format bag, the reasons why I chose that gear, and how it is
organized inside the bag. All the items described, with the exception of
35mm equipment that is sometimes taken out separately, are left
permanently in the bag. This makes it possible for me to always know
where eachitem is. It also prevents me from forgetting to pack
something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While inadequate for backpacking or even some long hikes (another
article will detail my camera bags for those situations), for working
near the car and moderate hikes (as long as the Subway in Zion), the
Lowepro Super-trekker is my choice because it provides quick access,
good organization, and reasonable carrying ability. In addition, it
offers sufficient protection for shipping by air, and a rain cover that
makes it possible to leave it or cache it outside even in rainy weather.
I have checked in the bag numerous times with minimal damage to the gear
(limited to the cable releases). I have also left it several times out
in the elements, for example when working in Denali together with a
camping backpack (I want to reassure you that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t carrying both
simultaneously, but a discussion of Denali logistics would be alone
worth another article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-exterior&#34;&gt;The exterior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;super-trekker3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;600&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;497&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The exterior of my Super-trekker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I don&amp;rsquo;t carry the tripod by hand, it is secured to the bag in
central position by the bungee cord with blue hooks. The default bungee
cords, which are not as strong, are used to carry additional clothing
when needed. With my cheap bungee cord positioned that way, a Gitzo 1325
can easily be carried on the bag. Carrying such a large tripod on the
side would make the bag too unbalanced. The two external pockets are
used to carry non-photographic items including food, water, and
accessories such as umbrella, hat, gloves, knife, headlamp, map, and GPS
unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-intermediate-level&#34;&gt;The intermediate level&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;super-trekker2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;467&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The intermediate level of my Super-trekker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the inside of the cover flap, there is a mesh pocket which normally
contains just the focussing cloth. I use the Darkroom Innovations
excellent cloth (compact, light, wind-proof, water-resistant, and above
all, ensures good darkness, thanks to its tube design and elasticised
opening). Occasionally, the same mesh pocket would be used to carry
additional film in a boxes and a small changing bag, or a few more 5x7
holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the bag&amp;rsquo;s main compartment, there is a removable foam panel
with four clear zippered pockets that contains any accessories. For
shipping, I simply reverse this panel to protect the contents inside the
pockets, which would then be facing inside. One of the small pockets is
dedicated to 35mm accessories (film, spare battery, double spirit
level). The three other zippered pockets are detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;accessories1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;515&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The small zippered pocket.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pocket contains the two most indispensable accessories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silvestri tilting focussing lupe (compact, tilt useful for
combatting the light-falloff in the corners, 6x magnification useful
with fine-grained focussing screens such as the Boss).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bracket to attach the Canham compendium shade to the front standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other less used accessories include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microfiber lens cleaning cloth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small metric tape for calculating belows factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoknips II gadget for self-timer and repeatable timing of
exposures in the 2-4 sec. range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Micron flashlight (LED, long lasting, diffuse light) and Maglite
solitaire (Tungsten bulb, brigher at a distance) to be used as
focussing aids in dim light, as well as for emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spirit level (mostly for making sure standards are aligned with
extreme rises).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hex key (for fixing problems with the QR plates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;filters1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;398&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The middle zippered pocket.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pocket contains round filters for dual use 35mm/LF: they consist of
Heliopan warm-tone Kaeseman Circular polarizers in 72mm and 77mm, Nikon
81B warming filters in 72mm and 77mm. There is also a Heliopan
wide-angle linear polarizer (front element is larger than than filter
thread to preven vignetting) in 67mm, as well as Nikon a 52mm polarizer
which are both used only for LF. All round filters are in B&amp;amp;W soft
plastic boxes. The Canon remote controler is used not only with the 35mm
camera (cable release, extended self-timer, long exposures), but also
its timing function is used for long LF exposures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;filters2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;472&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The bottom zippered pocket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pocket contains a small Outdoor Research mesh bag which holds the
rectangular filter system, a Heliopan 0.45 center filter in 67mm to
compensate for light fall-off in some shots with the Schneider 110 XL
and the Nikkor &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (this is carried in a push-on lens cap inside a soft
pouch), and a Lunar-Star F2 incident/flash meter (rarely used, as for
most landscape situations I prefer to meter with the 35mm camera).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;filters3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;467&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The filter bag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filter bag contains a Lee holder, wide-angle rings in 67mm and 77mm,
a regular ring in 52mm, three step-up rings to use the Lee holders on
other filter diameters, and a pouch containing resin Hitech filters.
Those include graduated neutral density 4x5 (GND), with both soft and
hard transistions in 2 f-stops and 3 f-stops, combination GND and
warming filter, and two 4x4 filters: warming filter (81B), and neutral
density filter (used to obtain longer exposures time to smooth moving
water). The Lee system, with its wide-angle rings, works without
vignetting even for wide-angle lenses. The Hitech filters are considered
as good as the Lee filters (some think they are produced by the same
factory), but their cost is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-inside&#34;&gt;The inside&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;super-trekker1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;467&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The inside of my Super-trekker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside of the bag contains the cameras, lenses, film holders. I
normally carry five or six 5x7 holders at a time. Note that I have added
two large Velcro pieces to hold more firmly the removable panel, since
the stock Velcro attachements are too small and would often let the
removable panel come loose. In 35mm, in general I carry one Canon EOS
body with a mid-range zoom, one telephoto zoom lens, and one wide-angle
zoom lens. The 35mm body is used not only independently, but also as a
viewfinder and a meter for the LF camera. The 35mmm equipment is placed
at the top of the bag, so I can access it without need to opening
entirely the bag or lay it flat. There is some space between the
external dividers and the exterior shell of the bag. This space is used
to carry the accessories listed in the next image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;accessories3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;590&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Accessories carried on the periphery of the Super-trekker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those accessories include the Canham compendium shade (always useful to
improve image contrast by reducing flare and cuting down the image
circle, also protects the lens while working in the rain), a small grey
card, four step-up rings that provide additional redundancy, should a
filter be misplaced or damaged, and a folded piece of foil that can be
attached to the removable panel of the Super-trekker to transform it
into a reflector. This can be useful for adding a bit of fill light for
macros shots or a close foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lenses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;356&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Large format lenses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own 7 large format lenses, which cover focals from 90mm (equivalent of
a 18in 35mm) to 720 (equivalent of a 135 in 35mm). All of them are good
performers, relatively recent and multicoated, which is useful since my
work is color. You will remark that I have a mix of each of the four
major brands. Since I do not do work that require critical color
matching (such as product illustration), this has not posed me any
problem. All of my lenses are mounted on Technika lens boards, which is
the de-facto standard for field cameras, smaller than the Toyo boards (I
also own a Tech IV that I almost never use these days). I prefer the
original Technika boards. Despite lensboards being very simple objects,
there is actually a difference in quality. The four most frequently used
lenses have a cable release permanently attached to them to speed-up
set-up. It is necessary to remove the cable release before shipping,
since in my experience, the cable releases are the only piece of
equipment to have been damaged in transit (they break near the socket).
The front element is protected by a UV filter that I remove if the
weather conditions are fine. Those lenses, pictured on the first row (in
the four compartments above the camera) are, left to right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuji C &lt;sup&gt;450&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.5 (The long lens to have if you have enough bellows:
longest non-telephoto lens in a #1, amazingly compact and light for
the focal, huge image circle that will cover even 7x17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikkor M &lt;sup&gt;300&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (Compact and light Tessar-type lens of excellent
quality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schneider Apo-Symmar &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.6 (Classic Plasmat lens, considered to be
one of the best. Slightly wider than a normal lens, it is the
easiest to focus among the lenses I own, thanks to the
aperture/focal length combination. My second most used lens)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schneider Super-Symmar &lt;sup&gt;110&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.6 XL (Cutting-edge design for
remarkable compacity, weight, and brightness compared to the classic
Biogon-type wide-angle lenses, also more sharp corner to corner. I
use it for more than 50% of the images, equivalent to a 24 in 35mm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are the following less used lenses, pictured on the
second row (left to right):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikkor T &lt;sup&gt;720&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; (Telephoto design, usable with less than 600m of
bellows. I often leave this one behind, esp. on hikes. It&amp;rsquo;s shallow
DOF, small image circle for 5x7, and above all sensitivity to
vibrations make it somehow difficult to use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rodenstock Apo-Sironar-S &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.6 (Compact and light, but image
circle a bit tight for 5x7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikkor SW &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (The lightest of all modern 90mm lenses, it has also
more coverage than other &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lenses, making it appropriate for 5x7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 90 and 150 are carried in the same compartment, with the 90 secured
in a Domke wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;camera.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;ldquo;700&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;388&amp;rdquo;}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Large format camera and bag bellows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My camera of choice is the Canham wood field in the 5x7 format, with a
couple of modifications. I replaced the standard bellows with the more
flexible MQC bellows, as well as the rather coarse and dim focussing
screen with a Boss screen. I installed a metric scale on a focussing
rail, and two additional spirit levels, one on the back, and another one
on the bed. For more details, see my &lt;a href=&#34;http://lflf.surge.sh/canham/canham.html&#34;&gt;review of the 5x7
KBC&lt;/a&gt;. A Really Right Stuff plate is permanently
attached under the bed of the camera for tripod mounting. I carry the
wide-angle bellows underneath the camera (under a large grey card that
serves as divider), but since installing the MQC bellows, I have had
rarely the need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bag contains practically everything I need for photographing in
35mm and LF, and I can operate fast out of it. It might look big, but
there isn&amp;rsquo;t much more room left for non-photographic items, or
photographic items such as additional 35mm lenses or additional LF backs
and holders. However, since it weights already more than 50lbs, I am not
sure I would want to carry more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large format photography: Classic 4x5/5x7 cameras&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;classic-4x5-5x7-cameras&#34;&gt;Classic 4x5/5x7 cameras&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.terragalleria.com/&#34;&gt;Q.-Tuan Luong&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;the Large
Format Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kodak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burke and James&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Korona&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cameras were made at a time when 5x7 was still a popular format.
They come with 4x5 and 5x7 backs. Make sure you get the back you want-
either 4x5 or 5x7- they cost about \$100 for each separatly for the
cheaper cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo; The rigidity depends a lot on the condition of the camera. Of this
group I would place the Kodak 2D in first place for rigidity with the
Ansco/Agfa comming in a close second. The B&amp;amp;J is probably the floppiest
of the bunch. OTOH, the B&amp;amp;J has the most complete movements and the
Kodak 2D the least. Often sloppy cameras can be tightened up a lot by
replacing screws which have become loose in the wood with slightly
larger ones, or where the wood is torn up, by drilling out the softened
wood and filling the holes with hardwood plugs. I have two Agfa/Ansco
cameras, one 8x10 and the other a 5x7. The 5x7 is pretty rigid, the
8x10, after working it over, adequately rigid. I think the Korona is
about the same as the Agfa/Ansco but I don&amp;rsquo;t own one so don&amp;rsquo;t have the
kind of intimate experience with it I do with the Ansco&amp;rsquo;s. &amp;ldquo; &lt;strong&gt;Richard
Knoppow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;kodak&#34;&gt;Kodak&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design is a little different from the current flatbed cameras. There
is a double rail hinging up and secured to the main part of the camera
by a metal snap. There is no telescoping bed, the bed is fixed and the
standards move on the bed (more or less like current monorails). A short
piece of the bed has the tripod mount and is just wide enough to allow
both standards to be compressed together on this section. A second
longer piece is hinged to the first and screws in place with a
thumbscrew. When hinged up, the whole package is fairly small, though
not nearly as small as a Wisner or similar field camera of the same
size. The bellows extension is around 12&amp;rdquo; (which is very short for a 5x7
camera). There is also an optional extension rail which is separate, and
extension bellows (mine came without it, but I have seen complete
cameras at shows). It screws in just like the hinged rail, but is not
attached to the camera with a hinge. Because it&amp;rsquo;s not attached, it&amp;rsquo;s
often missing from the cameras these days and is almost impossible to
find seperately. With the extenion rail, you probably get about 20&amp;rdquo;. The
camera is made of cherrywood and brass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front and the rear standards have geared focusing knobs. Therefore
both of the standards can be moved forward to use wide-angle lenses.
Unfortunately, the tripod socket is not mobile and it is situated on the
rear. It might be possible to use a clamp on the focussing rails to move
the attaachment point further. Movements are front rise, and back tilt
and swing all, geared. These movements are quite limited. In particular
I have found that the amount of tilt available within the geared range
is not sufficient even to get the ground plane in sharp focus. The
version that I have (ie without the back rail and extension bellows) has
very short bellows of about 12 inches. The camera has a medium weight
(at around 7lbs) and bulk, It is very fast to open and close, especially
since you don&amp;rsquo;t need to remove the lens. It is quite well-made and
sturdy, quite rigid, and can be bought for \$200. If you are using
normal lenses and don&amp;rsquo;t need lots of movements, this camera might work
well for you. Some models might be considered as antiques, since they
were built in the beginning of this century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:zebracom@synapse.net&#34;&gt;David Hosten&lt;/a&gt; own and use Kodak&amp;rsquo;s Model
33a, which he believes is a Kodak 2D. The front standard is immobile
except for rise. Focus is with the back standard, which includes swing,
tilt, and shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some photos see of a refubished 8x10 model, see &lt;a href=&#34;burke-james/restore8x10.html&#34;&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B&amp;amp;J was a huge Chicago camera store that bought out several samll camera
and lens manufacturers and sold the products under house brands, a
little like Calumet now. B&amp;amp;J stuff was always good quality and very good
value. They have been out of business for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B&amp;amp;J mad some variations on these cameras. Some are &amp;ldquo;tailboard&amp;rdquo; i.e.
focus only from the back and some have both front and rear focus. They
were well made cameras (of Maple of all things under the gray paint)
cheaper when new than &amp;ldquo;name brand&amp;rdquo; (Eastman or Ansco) but just as good.
They are probably a little crude compared to the current brass and wood
cameras but do the job. Strictly industrial grade, no-nonsence,
glamour-free cameras. It is moderately heavy and bulky (about the same
as the Kodak). The camera is made of a battleship grey painted maple and
has red bellows. I have seen a B&amp;amp;J beautifully refurbished by Patrick
Alt (1324 South Figueroa #101 LA, CA 90015, 213-784-3087). He asked
something around \$800 for the refurbished camera (the camera in
original condition can be bought for less than \$300).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic design is similar to the Kodak, with the double rail. However,
this camera has more movements than any other classic camera. It might
be less rigid than the Kodak for this reason. Read on the net:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They are a functional camera, but do NOT compare nicely with a Wisner
(or even a new Wista). The movements are slightly more limited, and a
lot less user freindly. The stability of the standards is were they
truely look bad (compared to Wisner). If my B&amp;amp;J is aimed down, the back
WILL change position when I load the holder (I&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn to focus
while putting some pressure on the top of the back in these
situations!!). Even the front standard moves quite a bit between it&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;adjustable&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo; modes.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Tom Ferguson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The B&amp;amp;J is rather wobbly, though mine is not in great condition. I&amp;rsquo;ve
seen other B&amp;amp;J&amp;rsquo;s that were later versions that seem much more solid than
mine, but still not as rigid as a Wisner. I would look carefully at the
camera and make sure the locks on the focusing tracks lock solidly and
do not cause the standards to rotate when the locks are applied. The
locks on the rear standard of my camera will rotate around completely
(the locks are level cam locks and should only rotate part way) and
applying the rear lock moves the standard forward about 5 degrees
(enough to make focusing a real pain).&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;John Sparks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any B&amp;amp;J camera you find today is quite old. The design was built to a
price- much less that a Deardorff and the like. Because they were cheap
from the get-go, many were &amp;ldquo;ridden hard and put away wet&amp;rdquo;. The owners
didn&amp;rsquo;t take the best care of them. This, coupled to a design that wasn&amp;rsquo;t
the ultimate makes for a camera- 40-50 years down the line- that can be
pretty sad. That said, a B&amp;amp;J in good shape can do the job. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a
few modifications to mine (I have 2 4x5/5x7 combos and an 8x10) to make
them better. I&amp;rsquo;ve also reglued and rescrewed mine- pulled out all the
screws from the wood, glued in a &amp;lsquo;twig&amp;rsquo; in the hole and redrilled and
reseated the screws- and they have really stiffened up. On the 4x5/5x7,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to stiffen it up by screwing down the U-shaped metal
support for the back solid to the rear focus mechanism. This loses real
shift and swing, but I don&amp;rsquo;t seen to miss it. I noticed the hinge
problem on one of my 4x5/5x7 cameras. I took it apart and bent the hinge
so it would go flat and reseated it in the bed. I reseated the screws
and bedded the hinge in 3M 5200 (a boat sealent) to keep things right. A
B&amp;amp;J is cheap. You have to live with a few things in order to use them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had good results with mine and I actually like fiddling with the
wood. If you can&amp;rsquo;t deal with it, get something better- or something made
of metal. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some good deals on Graphic View I (wish I still had
mine!) which is a decent cheap monorail.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Benedict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo; I have been using a 5x7 B&amp;amp;J for over a year. I bought it several years
ago and put it aside. A couple of observations/warnings: this is not a
nice tight camera with smooth focussing like th modern ones. The rear
standard is a flimsy piece of bent aluminum that moves around a lot when
you are trying to focus. The focussing geared rail is aluminum and may
be badly worn and rough. There is nothing but the tightness of the
screws to keep the movements from moving, the little tin tabs that are
supposed to act as locks are a joke. This can be a very frustrating
camera to use because of the way all the parts can move around, I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to a novice.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Frank Kolwicz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;korona-description-by-don-abelson-dabelson-ccnet-com&#34;&gt;Korona (description by Don Abelson dabelson@ccnet.com)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is of the classic wooden-flat bed view camera design, but
with many more movements than the Kodak. There are complete front
movements:geared rise &amp;amp; fall,manual swing,tilt,and shift; both front and
rear focus, with easy locking, and rear geared tilt and manual swings.
There is ample bellows draw to focus a long focal length lens (such as a
450mm Nikkor M) and even some additional length for close-focusing. All
movements are ample for most uses. It weighs only slightly over 6
pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

recently acquired Calumet Cadet 4x5&amp;rdquo; view camera. I shoot Fuji
Quickloads in a Fuji Quickload holder (for which I tend to favor
Fujichrome Provia 100F) and proof my shots using Polaroid film for which
I have a Polaroid 545i holder. I am quite pleased with the results so
far and am very excited at the prospect of further exploring the
possibilities of the 4x5&amp;rdquo; format!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.millervisuals.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-Art Prints: Illustrations And Drawings Of Robert And Photographs
Of Martin Miller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - For most of the last
32 years, I have been using photography as a creative means to explore
the metaphysical or spiritual dimension of life as distinct from its all
too pervasive material dimension. The natural world has been the subject
of my camera’s eye, but the mystery of the human psyche has been the
subject of my inner eye. The organizing principle of my work is no less
a challenge than the apprehension and expression through visual metaphor
of the hidden realms of the mind, the source of both our fears and our
miraculous creative capacities. My explorations have gravitated to three
sources of inspiration and insight into The Great Mystery: the
collective unconscious, mysticism, and the order/chaos synergy. The
literal subjects of my photographs may be wood, water, and rock, but, at
their best, they evoke the essential mystery of life and the possibility
of man&amp;rsquo;s spirit transcending his material existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zonesystem.de&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine Print Photography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - The intense
occupation with black-and-white photography revealed me a great amount
of possibilities on picture compositions, ways of expression, showed me
the possible combinations of forms and tone scales. The higher time
expenditure and expense of the Large format equipment and of the own
laboratory require a more concentrated method of working. For a long
term though it pays itself off through more convincing pictures. The
intense occupation with black-and-white photography trained my eye for
graphic forms and special tone scale conditions. After a phase of &amp;ldquo;color
abstinence&amp;rdquo; I recognized the possibilities of extending these forms and
tone scale conditions also into the color photography, because I am
convinced that their conscious use can also be used there. I got clear
to me that neither an exclusive black-and-white nor exclusive color
photography is better but that every subject requires its own individual
conversion by the photographer instead. There seldom are subjects which
are really convincing at these two different worlds. I generally prefer
the black-and-white photography, but I would also further like to
sensitize conscious using of color as another element for the picture
composition. In first place, forms, the tone scale as well as their
relations to each other fascinate me. Their representation in gray or
color depends both on the subject and on my inner ideas. I am neither
pupil of Ansel Adams nor of Joseph Beuys. (Please check out my other

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenspun.com/boohoo/related.tcl?page_id=LFcommercial&#34;&gt;reader contributed list of commercial resources for LF
photography&lt;/a&gt;.
Just a few words about where to shop based on my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the US, the largest New York mail-order stores (B&amp;amp;H and Adorama)
are reliable, have a large inventory, and competitive prices. They
can ship anywhere in the world. Calumet is more expensive but offer
better service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialty stores (such as Photomark, The View Camera Store, Badger
Graphics, and plenty of others I haven&amp;rsquo;t dealt with personally)
carry difficult-to-find items, and can sometimes offer significantly
lower prices than the large stores thanks to alternative supplying
schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also a number of used camera stores which stock lots of LF
equipment, and are your best bet to find old and/or inexpensive
lenses and cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to look overseas, for some items, the savings can
be dramatic, and the delivery as fast as from within the US. Robert
White in the UK is a highly rated European dealer, and very easy to
deal with. Christoph Greiner (chr.greiner.photo@t-online.de) in
Germany can have better prices on some German-made items. Several
readers have had a good experience with New Sankyo Camera Co in Hong
Kong (newsanky@hkstar.com), however the payment has to be made by
wire transfer. The duty fees are less than 5% and if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky,
you won&amp;rsquo;t even be charged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large format photography: contact prints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;contact-prints-are-they-that-special&#34;&gt;Contact prints: are they that special ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiled by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.terragalleria.com/&#34;&gt;Q.-Tuan Luong&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;the
Large Format Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffered through a period of &amp;ldquo;format confusion&amp;rdquo; about a year ago and
in that time I went through several cameras- 8x10, 7x17, 11x14 and
12x20. The allure of the contact print was just over powering and the
results made the weight and inconvenience a minor consideration. About
the same time I started to use a locked away Deardorff 5x7 and I
composed several pictures with that to match the perspective of my ULF
prints.After looking VERY closely, I managed to convince myself that
there was not really enough of a difference at normal viewing distances
to warrant the fuss and bother of the bigger cameras (not to mention
expense); so I sold off all my ULF stuff and happily went on using the
5x7 enlarging to 18x24 with no regrets. Then two things happened: first,
after not looking at them for over a year I looked at my old 11x14 and
12x20 contact prints. Big mistake!Yes, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a LOT of difference
but damn it I can SEE it (even with my ageing eyes!) BTW, alot of people
won&amp;rsquo;t see it -you have to be somewhat fanatical! Secondly, my friend
Burkhardt from Austria visited me and showed me a lot of his prints.
Once again, the contact 8x10&amp;rsquo;s made me drool but ,more interestingly, I
loved several 8x20 and 12x20 prints that he showed me. In a couple of
cases I had to ask him if they were contacts or not. They WERE&amp;rsquo;NT. They
were enlargements from 8x10 masked in camera to 4x10 and 6x10
respectively and enlarged to the 8x20 and 12x20 final prints.Were they
really indistinguishable from contact prints of that size? Well, when I
was looking only at them I thought that they WERE contacts. When I
compared my own proportional enlargements to contacts of that size there
WAS a difference but &amp;hellip; My conclusion? Well, unless you are a fanatic
(and there ARE some of us around) you can get pretty good results with
todays emulsions and optics. I also think that it is the FORMAT of the
print that can make a difference 12x20 is such a great format!(is it
because of our movie addiction?) and 8x20 is also very appealing because
I think that is the way our eyes look, sweeping in a large horizontal
view&amp;hellip; Because these formats are so appealing I think that enlargements
in those proportions will look great especially from large format negs
i.e. 8x10 and I bet even my 5x7 will be more than fine as should 4x5.
BUT, I tell you&amp;hellip;.there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like a big contact print,
nothing!!!Also, I love AZO! &lt;strong&gt;Richard Kuzniak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience, through viewing at exhibitions and in my own work, is
that there is a very subtle difference between the two. It&amp;rsquo;s not that
enlargement from 4x5 is not sharp; it is fine. However, the 8x10 seems a
little more &amp;ldquo;lifelike&amp;rdquo;. For example, a contact print is the best way to
&amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; snow or sand in a print. You can sense the granular surfaces. I
have several fine prints from 4x5 that contain snow/sand and they do not
convey the same sense of surface texture. I am not sure how one would go
about measuring these characteristics, but they do exist. &lt;strong&gt;George
Papas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use both 4x5 and 8x10. I can generally see a difference in B&amp;amp;W 11x14
prints in the 2 formats and can almost always see a difference in 16x20
prints in the 2 formats. These observations come from looking at lots of
prints of different subjects made on the 2 formats. In the few cases
where I&amp;rsquo;ve made photographs of the same subject on both formats, I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything in an 8x10 print from each that indicated anything
superior about the 8x10 contact though the prints are never completely
identical. I have made a few 1:1 enlargements from 4x5 negatives and
compared them with 4x5 contact prints (I&amp;rsquo;ve never done this with 8x10,
though I may have to give it a try now) and always prefered the
enlargements (I found it impossible to make the prints identical). From
those experiments, I think there must be some visible difference between
enlargements and contact prints that someone could learn to recognize. I
don&amp;rsquo;t think there is anything magic or superior to a contact print (I
actually found the 1:1 prints through an enlarging lens sharper than the
contact prints but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it depends on how close the light used for
the contacts is to a true point source). I was also using a condenser
enlarger at the time and the different grades of paper required make
matching prints harder. My prints were on the same paper (probably
Ilford Multigrade FB, or Oriental Seagull graded, it was a few years
ago). If the prints are on different papers, the differences are likely
to be even wider (I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to make truely identical prints
on any two different papers). &lt;strong&gt;John Sparks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its impossible to argue with someone else&amp;rsquo;s experience. I can&amp;rsquo;t see such
a difference [between 8x10 contact and enlarged from 4x5] in my own
work. I can see differences in quality as the size of the negative goes
up for a given size enlargement. Certainly the difference between 35mm
and 6x6cm is quite obvious in an 8x10 print. I can see some difference
(but much less than in the first case) in comparing 6x6cm to 4x5 but I
am not sure when looking at old prints whether a photo was taken on 4x5
or 8x10 for an 8x10 print. That&amp;rsquo;s just my visual judgement. I do not at
the moment have an 8x10 enlarger. It would be interesting to make 1:1
projection prints and compare those to contact prints. There are a few
folks out there who have the where withall to do this and I am
interested in observations. I also suspect that some of the &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo;
quality that contact prints are supposed to have are historical memory,
so to speak. When projection paper first came out around the &amp;lsquo;teens, it
was Bromide emulsion which did not have very good tonal quality. It was
distinctly inferior to the mostly Chloride contact papers available
then. Modern enlarging paper is a far cry from this stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t think
any purely Chloride paper has been made for decades. Kodak Azo is a
Chlorobromide paper, like all Kodak papers for over fifty years.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-large-format-photography-info-site&#34;&gt;About the Large Format Photography Info site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-this-site-about&#34;&gt;What is this site about ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;largeformatphotography.info&lt;/a&gt; is a primary resource and community of
large format photographers on the internet (including photographers
working with MF view cameras) . It might be a small section of
photography, but the dedication, knowledge, and skill of its
practitioners is usually very high, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find here one of the most
remarkable open photographic communities anywhere, populated by many
experts, but welcoming to beginners as well. The site consists of
several hundred article pages with comments, and a discussion forum with
several tens of thousands messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to provide a place where large format enthusiasts can
come and exchange freely ideas and help. It is independent, non-profit,
entirely free of advertising and commercial activity, and while we
consider that its contents belongs as a whole to the LF community,
technically each contributor retains the exclusive copyrights to his
postings and the option to have them removed on request, as we do not
clain any rights on them. No financial contribution is required, or even
invited, because we consider that the most valuable contribution is the
time spent by members to contribute contents and maintain the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;largeformatphotography.info is operated on a volunteer basis by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.terragalleria.com/&#34;&gt;QT
Luong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://tomwestbrook.com&#34;&gt;Tom
Westbrook&lt;/a&gt;, using server space generously
donated by &lt;a href=&#34;http://reid.org/brian/&#34;&gt;Brian Reid&lt;/a&gt;, refered to us by Tim
Atherton. The forum is moderated by Ralph Barker, Kirk Gittings, Ken
Lee, Neil Poulsen, and Tom Westbrook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q.-Tuan Luong started large format photography in 1993. There were a lot
of things which were mysterious back then. After shooting thousands of
sheets of film, some of them are still mysterious, but in the while, he
has beneficiated from advice of really knowledgeable persons on the net.
This site started in 1995 as an attempt to give back to the community by
detailing a few things he had learned, and displaying in an organized
form the information that he had gathered from the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the people from whom he has learned the most in the early years,
and whose Usenet postings have been reused to begin this site are
Jean-David Beyer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.butzi.net/&#34;&gt;Paul Butzi&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Knoppow,
Barry Sherman, John Sparks, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thalmann.com/&#34;&gt;Kerry Thalmann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the site evolved, many people contributed directly articles written
specifically for the site. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Barclay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Barr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ralph Barker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jolyon Barrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eirik Berger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emmanuel Bigler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kevin Bourque&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeroen Bruggeman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geoffrey Chen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carlos Co&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nathan Congdon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John A. Cook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darin Cozine&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Stewart Ethier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Geiger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeffrey Goggin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jason Sanford Greenberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masayoshi Hayashi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edward A. Hoover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David C. Karp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James M. Kates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pat Kearns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael J. Kravit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Kumpf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ralph Lambrecht&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Howard Lester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank Loeffel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rich Long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Micah Marty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J. C. Metcalf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Mutmansky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steven Nestler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John O&amp;rsquo;Connell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Owen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luca Paradisi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leigh Perry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Phillips (aka GreyWolf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gerald Pierce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ernest Purdum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jared Radin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ron Reeder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Sarsgard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eugene Singer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan Smith&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Stein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Stimac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nick Thornton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ellis Vener&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinier de Vlaam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Westbrook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob Wheeler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sean Yates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(sorry, I might have missed a few). And everyone who contributes a point
of view by leaving a comment on a web page deserves thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few photographers have also authorized this site to reproduce some of
their previously published writings. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Hansma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Howard Bond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Petterson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert White&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Sexton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he started putting up this site, readers began to email him
questions, many of them beyond what he knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum started in 1997, using server, bandwidth, and forum software
(Lusenet) provided generously for free by Philip Greenspun to the
internet community. This software, more carefully though of, in its
simplcity, than many more recent ones, is one of the main factors who
made this forum a success. It has grown to become an outstanding
resource thanks to readers, including more than 60000 postings by
mid-2002. Besides providing the essential community tools used by the
first incarnation of this site, Philip Greenspun has also been a
constant source of inspiration through his own site, especially in its
former non-commercial incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2002, service on Philip Greenspun&amp;rsquo;s Lusenet system was abruptly
discontinued for the LF Forum. The QA Forum software on
largeformatphotography.info replicates the Lusenet system, a testimony
to its design excellence. It is the product of the work of several
volunteers. The idea of rewriting Lusenet using the more widely
available PHP/Mysql platform was due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://joshwand.com/&#34;&gt;Josh
Wand&lt;/a&gt; who developed a first prototype. The effort
was subsequently taken over by &lt;a href=&#34;http://binoni.nu/&#34;&gt;Bjorn Nilsson&lt;/a&gt;. After
Bjorn suffered a severe accident, the work was finished by &lt;a href=&#34;http://tomwestbrook.com&#34;&gt;Tom
Westbrook&lt;/a&gt;, who also transfered the original
postings from Lusenet based on data graciouly provided to us by Philip
Greenspun. All volunteered their time and talent to make this happen.
Some history is available in &lt;a href=&#34;polls/&#34;&gt;old polls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;lfphotoinfo.html&#34;&gt;Why not at
photo.net ?&lt;/a&gt;. []{#terms}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large format photography: commercial ressources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;commercial-ressources-for-large-format-photography&#34;&gt;Commercial ressources for large format photography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiled by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.terragalleria.com/&#34;&gt;Q.-Tuan Luong&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;the
Large Format Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the main body of this page are listed a few useful contacts which
are NOT on the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More NON-INTERNET contacts can be added by you (and seen by
everybody)
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenspun.com/com/qtluong/photography/lf/distributors.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contacts which ARE ON THE INTERNET are listed

&lt;p&gt;One of the best US distributors is Photomark in Phoenix. See under
&amp;ldquo;Canham&amp;rdquo;. Other distributors in the US which are said to be reliable are
Badger Graphics (Michigan) and the F-Stops here (Santa Barbara).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diane Henry is the Arca-Swiss rep at 773-248-2513.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera designer Phillipe Vogt number is (in Switzerland)

&lt;p&gt;I bought my camera from Photomark following John Sparks advice, and have
found Rod to be a nice person to deal with. Phoenix is close to Mesa, so
Rod can expedite things with Keith. For more distributors, ask Keith.
There are many now.&lt;/p&gt;
