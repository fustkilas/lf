<p><strong>By <a href="mailto:sparks@col.hp.com">John Sparks</a></strong></p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-goerz-lens">What is a Goerz lens?</h4>

<p>Goerz is the name of a now defunct lens company who had a reputation for
making very good lenses at the time. Goerz was bought by Zeiss in the
1920&rsquo;s or 30&rsquo;s if I remember correctly. There was also an American Goerz
that remained independent until it was bought by Schneider in the 60&rsquo;s
or 70&rsquo;s.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-dagor">What is a Dagor?</h4>

<p>The Dagor was one lens made by Goerz. By today&rsquo;s standards it would be
considered a normal wide field lens not a true wide angle. It&rsquo;s still a
pretty sharp lens, but not really in the same class as a modern lens.
You will not have tons of coverage with a 90mm Dagor on 4x5 (I think it
covers 80 to 85 degrees or so at f/45). Zeiss made a wide angle f/9
Dagor (most Dagors are f/6.8) that covers 100 degrees at f/32 and there
is an American Goerz Wideangle Dagor that covers 90 degrees at f/45.
Most Dagors are uncoated and will have less contrast than a modern lens.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-an-angulon">What is an Angulon?</h4>

<p>This is a very similar design to the Dagor, but made by Schneider as a
wide angle lens. It has a little more coverage than the Dagor (100
degrees at f/45</p>

<p>This is an older lens design. It&rsquo;s not a bad lens by today&rsquo;s standards,
but it has much less coverage than a modern lens like the Super Angulon.
It will be slightly less sharp and contrasty compared to a modern lens
and must be stopped down to at least f/22 for use and gets it&rsquo;s maximum
coverage at f/45 (aprox 100 degrees). The Super Angulons and equivalents
from Nikon and Rodenstock are usable wide open (not that view camera
lenses are typically used that way), develop maximum coverage at f/16 or
f/22 and cover over 100 degrees at these aperatures (the Angulon
probably only covers about 80 degrees at f/22). The Angulon will also
have more light falloff toward the edges than the modern lenses. For
architecture with its large coverage requirements and work where large
aperatures and absolute maximum sharpness are necessary the Angulon is
probably not appropriate, but for many other uses it will work fine
within the coverage and aperature limitations. It might be particularly
appropriate for field work since it is much smaller and lighter than the
modern wide angles.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-super-angulon">What is a Super Angulon?</h4>

<p>This is the current modern wide angle lens made by Schneider. It has
been made for quite a while so there are slight variations. Now it&rsquo;s
made as an f/8 and a really new f/5.6XL. There are slightly older f/5.6
versions and even older f/6.8 version I think. Other similar modern wide
angle lenses are Nikkor SW (f/4.5 and f/8), Fuji (don&rsquo;t know the
letters, but I think the only 90mm they make are wide angles),
Rodenstock Grandagon (f/4.5 and f/6.8). The faster lenses (f/4.5 and
f/5.6) are really big, expensive and not best suited for field work
(because of their size and weight), they do cover a little more and are
easier to focus and are especially liked by architectual photographers
who need all the coverage they can get. I think the Schneider was the
first of these modern designs so you can probably find used Super
Angulons easier and cheaper than the others, but all are pretty similar.
The Super Angulons in the chrome barrels are earlier versions that cost
much less (because they are so obviously older), but are pretty much the
same lens as the new black versions so represent especially good deals.</p>

<h4 id="further-comments-on-angulons-vs-super-angulons">further comments on Angulons vs Super Angulons</h4>

<p>An Angulon at f/22 should cover about 83 degrees (5x7 with no
movements), at f32, it&rsquo;s probably about 90 degrees (5x7 with some
movements) and 100 degrees at f/45 (285mm, not quite 8x10). It might
cover 8x10 at f/64 but I think max coverage is reached by f/45. At f/45,
I doubt you could tell it apart from a Super Angulon due to diffraction,
the coverage only slightly less. The SA will be sharper at f/22 where it
covers a whole lot more (it reaches max coverage at f/22 instead of f/45
on the Angulon). The 120 Angulon might cover 4x5 at f/16, but it
probably should be used at f/22 for best results on 4x5.For a 90mm
Angulon to cover 5x7, it would have to be stopped down to f/45. A 90mm
Angulon will just barely cover 4x5 with no movements at f/22 and should
be used at f/32 for best results on 4x5.</p>

<p>The Schneider rep on Compuserve once wrote that the Angulon could no
longer be made because the glasses needed are no longer available.
That&rsquo;s not to say that a similar sized lens with the same coverage could
not be made with a different formulation and ne The Schneider rep said
the Super Symmar was their modern answer to the Angulon. The coverage at
f/22 is about the same as is it&rsquo;s closeup performance, but the Super
Symmar is a whole lot bigger than an Angulon and probably has much
smaller coverage than an Angulon at f/32 or f/45.</p>

<p>Modern wide angles at 120mm are big, but not so big they can&rsquo;t be
carried. The 210mm Angulon is where I see the real loss. It&rsquo;s plenty
sharp enough for 8x10 and the 210 Super Angulon is a real monster! The
120mm and 210mm Angulons were produced for a while after the Super
Angulon was introduced. I think that was before the current wide spread
interest in using large format cameras in the field. I think there would
be a lot more of a market for smaller lenses for field work these days
than when the Angulon was discontinued! Fuji had a lot of good ideas too
where many of their lenses reduced maximum aperature slightly to keep
them in smaller, lighter shutters. I think at least some of their lenses
would be a lot more popular today than when they pulled out of the US
market. Particularly the 250mm AS in a #0 shutter, 250mm W, 360mm AS,
450mm CS lenses all in #1 shutters unlike any competative lenses and
the 600mm CS lenses with no modern equivalent all particularly useful
for 8x10 field use (though there probably aren&rsquo;t enough 8x10 field
camera users to support a whole distribution network).</p>

<h4 id="the-longer-wide-ektars-and-angulons">the longer wide ektars and angulons</h4>

<p>The 135mm/6.3 (229mm circle) is a nice choice for 4x5. The 190mm/6.3
(318mm circle) is really a moderate wide angle for larger formats lens
and (it can even be used with 8x10 with no movements). I think there are
better choices for 4x5 in this focal length.</p>

<p>Again Angulons are moderate wide angles. The 120mm/6.8 (211mm circle) is
nice on 4x5, the <sup>210</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.8 (362mm circle) is nice on 8x10. There are much
better choices in 210mm lenses for 4x5.</p>

<p>In general, there is a trade off between the angle of coverage and the
sharpness of the lens. Wide angle designs are not the sharpest lenses,
but they are necessary for wide lenses to get enough coverage. Wide
angles are the case where modern lenses are really the best choice,
there are few older lenses 90mm or wider than can be used with any
movements on 4x5 and those few with really wide coverage are rather
soft.</p>

<p>Better choices in older lenses in the 180mm to 210mm range are regular
Ektars (the 203mm f/7.7 is often picked as a particularly good
inexpensive lens in this range, it covers 5x7 so allows for good
movements), Commercial Ektars, Schneider Symmars, Tessars, Dagors and
series VI Protars. More modern lenses in this range can often be found
in this range and will produce a good bit more contrast and somewhat
higher resolution. Lenses like Caltar&rsquo;s (not the older Ilex-Caltars),
older chrome Symmar-S, and older Sironar&rsquo;s are modern lenses with modern
coatings but often sell for moderate prices because they are not the
current offerings (and may be less expensive than older &ldquo;cult&rdquo; lenses
like the Dagor and Protar especially the later coated versions like the
Gold ring Dagors which seem way overpriced). The latest Caltar II-N
lenses are identical to Rodenstock Apo-Sironar-N lenses and quite good
but sell at reduced prices used, I bought a used 150mm Caltar II-N for
\$125 and it&rsquo;s the sharpest lens I own. The Caltar II-S are Symmar-S
lenses and also good.</p>

<h3 id="more-on-the-angulon">More on the Angulon</h3>

<p><em>NdE: There seems to have a large variation in quality among the
Angulons. If you buy one, make sure you can test it.</em></p>

<p>A 90mm or 120mm Angulon is not anywhere near the equivalent of a 90mm or
120 Super Angulon. The Angulon or regular Angulon as some people call
them have excellant coverage. They throw a very large circle without
vignetting but light fall of is extreme. I have used both the 90 &amp; 120mm
regular angulons and even on the 120mm with movements I saw light fall
off of over <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a stop. The edge sharpness falls off also. If you
don&rsquo;t use movements or if your use of movements are minimal either the
90 or 120 Angulon is a good cheap alternative to the more expensive
Super Angulons. But if you do use movements, and want the sharpest image
you can get to the edges of the frame I&rsquo;d suggest buying a Super Angulon
or Nikons version (SW) of the Super Angulon. <strong>Mark</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the 121 Super Angulon, but I have a 120
Angulon, and frankly, it sucks. I&rsquo;ve never seen it produce a truly sharp
image, even stopped all the way down or anywhere in between. I don&rsquo;t
like it very much. <strong>Eric Volpe</strong></p>

<p>I have the 90m f:6.8 Angulon, a 1958 lens, in fact, in as-new condition.
It is sharp and contrasty from f:8 upwards, and is exceptionally small.
I would suspect that the 12o Angulon (NOT Super), which is simply a
scaled up version of the90, using identical glass and figuring, except
the scaled-up dimensions, would perform as well as my 90, which is to
say very well, indeed. The 90 is amazingly flare-free by anybody&rsquo;s
standard. I have made numerous images with the disk of the sun in them,
yet having no washed-out spots or muddy shadows. I have not bought a
Super because they are so big and bulky, and by my standards, I can make
gorgeous 16x20&rsquo;s. so who cares if I&rsquo;m not up to date? <strong>Edward M.
Lukacs, LRPS</strong></p>

<p>My Angulon is a very old one. I suspect the problem is that Schneider&rsquo;s
quality control wasn&rsquo;t very good in the early thirties. Since the lens
is a variation on the Dagor design it ought to be capable of excellent
performance and from what I hear later ones live up to this. Schneider
seems to changed radically after WW-2. My impression is that before that
they were an economy lens maker with a reputation well below makers like
Zeiss, Voigtlander, Rodenstock, etc. The Xenotar for the Rollei camera
seems to have been the turn-around. I wonder if anyone has actual
knowledge of the company and can confirm or refute this. <strong>Richard
Knoppow</strong></p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more that some old large format lenses have marvelous
qualities as compared with modern offerings. All you have to do is see
the fairly substantial prices that places like Lens &amp; Repro regularly
get for 50+ year old optics to know that they are valuable, and are
often the best choice in a situation. The Angulons, in 4 x 5 and in 8 x
10, [in 8 x 10, eg., the 165mm and the 210mm] are tiny, flat lenses,
which take modest-sized filters, often will close into a field camera
without removing from the camera, and weigh I&rsquo;d guess one-tenth what the
enormous, modern Super-Angulons do. It&rsquo;s really hard to make a case for
the new very pricey S-A&rsquo;s and Grandagons and Super-Symmars unless one is
doing extremely demanding architectural work or product work. For those
of us who do landscapes, especially where weight and size are factors,
the older lenses are marvelous. And as the prices for old top quality
(eg Artars) long focal length lenses indicate, they are extremely
attractive for portrait work. <strong>Alan Heldman</strong></p>

<h3 id="older-wide-angle-lenses">Older wide-angle lenses</h3>

<p>Older wide angle lenses were not particularly good. There was tremendous
advancement in thiese lenses following WW2. The Schneider Super Angulon
and Rodenstock Grandagon were among the first really good WA&rsquo;s on the
market. What you have is the last of the Dagors, probably made in the
1960&rsquo;s with modern glass and redesign. Its a noticably better lens than
older versions so shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a criterion to judge pre-war
lenses of any type. Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any real
bargains in WA&rsquo;s. Older f/8 Super Angulons are available at reasonable
prices and perform well for what they cost. There wasn&rsquo;t much choice
pre- about 1950. In the pre-war era most photographers used B&amp;L or Zeiss
WA Protars (f/18!) or Wide Angle Dagors or Angulons. None of these
lenses will touch a modern WA.</p>

<p>The Metrogon is an arial photography lens made by Bausch &amp; Lomb. The
stated angle is 90deg. at small stops, so a 155 will just about cover an
8x10. These lenses have great fall off of illumination and were intended
to be used with a center-filter. All of the center-filters I&rsquo;ve seen for
this lens were combined with a yellow filter. They are critical about
element spacing so some care is reqired in remounting in a shutter. The
Wollensak is an old design and the ones I&rsquo;ve seen varied quite a lot in
quality of manufacture. One had enough bubbles in one of the elements to
affect the performance.</p>

<p>The 159 Wollensak will give you a decent picture on 8x10 if you stop it
down. Just barely covers the format. And watch out for the accuracy of
the older shutters. <strong>Robert Gurfinkel</strong></p>

<p>There are some other extreme wide-angle lenses out there that offer
decent performance, stunning coverage, and small size and weight. I
almost bought a 3&rdquo; Goerz Rectagon once; this lens was designed as an
aerial reconaissance lens for use with 5&rdquo; rollfilm Metrogons and a few
other lenses meant for aerial recon use were made in more focal lengths
than the Rectagons I&rsquo;ve played with; you might see if you can find one
that suits your purposes. The 3&rdquo; Rectagon was smaller than the <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
Angulon I had in my bagat the time, a far cry from the size of the <sup>65</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
and <sup>75</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> Super Angulons I&rsquo;ve since owned, which have been the largest
lenses in my bag by far. As a medium wide-angle, I find my 100mm WF
Ektar very good; sharper than the <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> Angulon was, and somewhat more
coverage, though it pays to take a loupe to the corners as there&rsquo;s an
outer anastigmatic point well within the circle of illumination, which
can be misleading. <strong>Thor Lancelot Simon</strong></p>

<h3 id="american-press-lenses">American Press lenses</h3>

<p><strong>By <a href="mailto:tim@fulcrum.me.rochester.edu">Timothy Takahashi</a></strong></p>

<pre><code>&gt;can anyone give me some recommendations for inexpensive (around
&gt;$200 street) used lenses for 4x5 cameras. Specifically, I'm using
&gt;a Crown Graphic, so I don't need to allow for a lot of movements.

The 8&quot; 203mm f/7.7 Kodak Ektar is a highly regarded optic.
It is of the 4-element symmetrical air-spaced design, is sharpest
at f/7.7 and retains its corrections closeup.
The 203 will cover 5x7. Consequently, it may be used with
considerable movements.

I think the closeup performance and movement potential will
be more than sufficient given the limited bellows draw of
a crown graphic.

I've seen 'em as inexpensive as $69 and as pricey as $275.
They were made over many years.

The other Ektars 127mm and 152mm f/4.7 and f/4.5 are tessar
type lenses. Quite sharp, 152mm can be used with minimal motions
127mm is designed for 3.25x4.25 and should not be used with
any motions. They are designed for use from 4 feet to
infinity.

&gt;I recently acquired an inexpensive 4x5 press camera (limited
&gt;movements). The camera was supplied with an optar 135mm f4.7 lens
&gt;in graphex shutter. After an experiment I was quite dissapointed with
&gt;the performance of the lens 

   The 135mm Optar is a fine lens. My impression is that your camera
is out of alignment. If the lensboard is not parallel to the film
plane, it follows that the corners will not be focused at the same
distance as the center. If you have a Graphic, the lens board is
alignable (re-alignable, mis-aligned). I'm not sure if a B+J or
Busch is adjustable for alignment (my 2x3 Busch *isn't*). 

   I have good things to say about American press lenses. The stuff
is quite good within limitations (mostly image circle size problems).
I particularly enjoy the simplicity of domestic shutters, as others
have heard privately, I am no fan of Compur Rapid shutters. As far
as sharpness is concerned, my Ektars are better than my Schneider
Angulon (particularly at the corners!).

   In any case here is a rough outline of image circle sizes (150mm is
needed to cover 4x5&quot;).

127mm Ektar/Tessar/Xenar/et.al.     ~160mm
135mm Optar/Tessar/Xenar/et.al.     ~160mm
150mm Ektar/Tessar/Xenar/et.al.     ~180mm
210mm Tessar/Xenar/et.al.           ~250mm
135mm Symmar                        ~190mm
150mm Symmar                        ~210mm
90mm  Angulon                       ~152mm
90mm  Super Angulon                 ~215mm

Less expensive lenses for 4x5&quot; include :

127mm Kodak Ektar f/4.7
127mm Wollensak Raptar f/4.5
135mm Graflex Optar/Wollensak Raptar f/4.5
135mm Schneider Kreuznach Xenar f/4.5
152mm Kodak Ektar f/4.5
162mm Graflex Optar/Wollensak Raptar f/4.5
190mm Graflex Optar/Wollensak Raptar f/4.5
203mm Kodak Ektar f/7.7

The 203mm is a 4-element/4-group Symmetrical design (good for closeups),
the others are nominally &quot;Tessar&quot; types. Curvature of field seems to
be the predominant lens abberation within the nominal image circle
(corners improve with stopping down).

<h3 id="comparisons-between-modern-normal-lenses">Comparisons between modern normal lenses</h3>

<p><strong>By Barry Sherman</strong></p>

<p>The APO-Symmar is the current Schneider offering, the Symmar-S is the
preveious offering and the Symmar predates the Symmar-S. Just something
to consider.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve compared my Fuji 210 f5.6 with the Rodenstock Sironar 210 f5.6 and
with the most recent Rodenstock APO-Sironar-N 210 f5.6. I mention this
because I would expect that the these Rodenstock lenses would be roughly
comparable to the Schneider offerings. I could detect no difference in
sharpness between the Fuji and the two Rodenstocks at enlargement sizes
of ~24x30. I was considering replacing my Fuji with a &ldquo;latest model&rdquo;
German lens but decided not to after doing these tests.</p>

<p>On the other hand, my Schneider APO-Symmar 135mm is definitely and
noticibly sharper than the Fuji 210mm (the reason that I was considering
replacing the Fuji). So it might be that a Schneider APO-Symar 210mm
would be sharper. I didn&rsquo;t compare one with my Fuji because I can&rsquo;t
afford the more expensive Schneider APO-Symmar 210mm.</p>

<h4 id="caltars">Caltars</h4>

<p>Another contender might be the Caltar II-N <sup>210</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.6 - this is reputed to
be Rodenstock glass assembled for Calumet. This is what Calumet told me
when I talked with them a few weeks ago. They said that &ldquo;Every second
lens that comes down the Rodenstock assembly line is stamped &lsquo;Caltar
II-N&rsquo; and every third is stamped &lsquo;Sinaron&rsquo;&ldquo;. We were talking about the
&ldquo;Symmetrical&rdquo; versions, not the &ldquo;Compact&rdquo; versions. The sales person
swore up and down that a Calter II-N 210mm f5.6 is identically equal to
a Rodenstock APO-Sironar-N 210mm f5.6. This is what I bought, compared
to my Fuji, determined to be no sharper than my Fuji and to have
slightly less contrast and returned.</p>
