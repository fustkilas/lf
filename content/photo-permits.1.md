| [Santa Clara                      | photography permit is to regulate |

|                                   |     damage to the site or claims  |
|                                   |     by others (e.g., a person     |

|                                   | In some cases, the issuing agency |
|                                   | charges a fee for engaging in the |
|                                   | permitted activity, so requiring  |
|                                   | a permit also helps ensure that   |
|                                   | the fee is collected.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The rationale for a permit is     |
|                                   | less clear when the activity has  |
|                                   | little potential for damage or    |
|                                   | disruption. Nonetheless, many     |
|                                   | public agencies require permits   |
|                                   | for photography done for          |
|                                   | “commercial” purposes, often      |
|                                   | without defining the term. But    |
|                                   | “commercial photography” has      |
|                                   | several different meanings among  |
|                                   | photographers and among public    |
|                                   | agencies. Photographers often     |
|                                   | distinguish between “commercial”  |
|                                   | and “editorial” work, sometimes   |
|                                   | with varying ideas of what        |
|                                   | belongs in each category; public  |
|                                   | agencies seldom recognize the     |
|                                   | distinction. At least ostensibly, |
|                                   | most state and local agencies in  |
|                                   | California require permits for    |
|                                   | any photography for “commercial   |
|                                   | purposes,” perhaps with the       |
|                                   | assumption that “commercial” is   |
|                                   | equivalent to “large-scale and    |
|                                   | disruptive.” These agencies       |
|                                   | typically regard as “commercial”  |
|                                   | any photography done with the     |
|                                   | intent of sale for profit,        |
|                                   | including editorial, stock,       |
|                                   | calendar, greeting card, and fine |
|                                   | art. Some agencies even claim to  |
|                                   | include images to be posted on a  |
|                                   | website, entered in a photo       |
|                                   | contest, or used in a commercial  |
|                                   | portfolio. In contrast, most      |
|                                   | federal agencies base permit      |
|                                   | requirements on the activity’s    |
|                                   | impact rather than on commercial  |
|                                   | intent, and accordingly require   |
|                                   | permits only when the photography |
|                                   | involves models or props.         |

|                                   | commercial photography was an     |

|                                   | impact on the locations in which  |
|                                   | they take place, sometimes        |
|                                   | involving large crews,            |
|                                   | considerable support equipment,   |
|                                   | numerous vehicles, temporary      |
|                                   | structures, and perhaps requiring |
|                                   | temporary closure of areas,       |
|                                   | trails, or roads. The activity    |
|                                   | merits regulation to protect      |
|                                   | resources and avoid undue         |
|                                   | interference with the normal      |
|                                   | activities of others, and in most |

|                                   | cooperation that a permit elicits |
|                                   | are well worth the effort to      |
|                                   | obtain the permit. Commercial     |
|                                   | still product shoots are usually  |
|                                   | planned well in advance and often |
|                                   | involve only a few locations, so  |
|                                   | that the logistics of obtaining   |
|                                   | permits and insurance are         |
|                                   | relatively straightforward. The   |
|                                   | cost of obtaining a permit is a   |
|                                   | customary business expense that   |
|                                   | is passed along to the client.    |
|                                   | There is little justification for |
|                                   | jeopardizing a commitment to a    |
|                                   | client and needlessly             |
|                                   | antagonizing agency staff by      |
|                                   | failing to obtain required        |
|                                   | permits for such activities. And  |
|                                   | in some cases, failure to obtain  |
|                                   | a required permit can result in a |

|                                   | Professional photography that     |
|                                   | doesn’t involve models or props   |
|                                   | is usually on the border of what  |
|                                   | does and what does not require a  |
|                                   | permit. The photographic activity |
|                                   | involved usually differs little,  |
|                                   | if at all, from that of a serious |
|                                   | or casual amateur who would not   |
|                                   | require a permit. The impact of   |
|                                   | the activity is often so low that |
|                                   | it’s nearly invisible, and not    |
|                                   | even considered when regulations  |
|                                   | are drafted. In contrast to       |
|                                   | motion picture or product shoots, |
|                                   | editorial, stock, and fine art    |
|                                   | photography often involves short  |
|                                   | visits to many locations          |
|                                   | administered by many different    |
|                                   | agencies, with specific locations |
|                                   | often chosen on short notice, so  |
|                                   | the logistics of obtaining        |
|                                   | permits and providing             |
|                                   | certificates of insurance can be  |
|                                   | considerable. In many cases,      |
|                                   | there is no immediate client, so  |
|                                   | the photographer must absorb the  |
|                                   | cost of obtaining the permits and |
|                                   | providing indemnification.        |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | It is easy to say that            |
|                                   | “potentially damaging or          |
|                                   | disruptive” activity merits       |
|                                   | regulation. But it is no easy     |
|                                   | task to express this concept in   |
|                                   | suitable regulatory language.     |
|                                   | Ideally, criteria for determining |
|                                   | whether a permit is required      |
|                                   | would be completely objective,    |
|                                   | easily evaluated by observation,  |
|                                   | and unambiguous to both           |
|                                   | regulators and those regulated.   |
|                                   | More than a few agencies have     |
|                                   | attempted this, and most have     |
|                                   | failed to achieve their           |
|                                   | objective.                        |

|                                   | required. But the definition of   |
|                                   | “sets and props” differs from the |
|                                   | conventional meanings in that it  |
|                                   | includes equipment as well as     |
|                                   | items that appear in the          |
|                                   | photograph. Most pieces of        |
|                                   | equipment described as “sets and  |
|                                   | props” are large items that are   |

|                                   | other than large-scale            |

|                                   | tripod are specifically excluded. |
|                                   | There is a considerable range     |
|                                   | between these two extremes, and   |
|                                   | it is not yet clear where the     |
|                                   | line will be drawn.               |

|                                   | ### Noncommercial Photography     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Photography for personal use      |
|                                   | doesn’t usually require a permit, |
|                                   | as long as you follow the same    |
|                                   | rules as the general public. A    |
|                                   | few sites do restrict the use of  |
|                                   | certain equipment (such as        |
|                                   | tripods or artificial lighting),  |
|                                   | or certain activities (such as    |
|                                   | leaving a tour group or leaving a |
|                                   | trail), but these restrictions    |
|                                   | are usually clearly stated as     |
|                                   | such, and not related to          |
|                                   | “commercial” intent.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | How do agency staff know the      |
|                                   | photography is for personal use?  |
|                                   | If they ask (or suggest that it   |
|                                   | isn’t), you tell them that it is. |
|                                   | Assuming, of course, that it is.  |
|                                   | Some agency staff may initially   |
|                                   | assume that anyone using a        |
|                                   | tripod, medium- or large-format   |
|                                   | camera, long lenses, light meter, |
|                                   | or other “professional” equipment |
|                                   | is doing “commercial” photography |
|                                   | and requires a permit. However,   |
|                                   | such equipment is used by         |
|                                   | amateurs and professionals alike, |
|                                   | and in most cases, sales to       |
|                                   | amateurs considerably exceed      |
|                                   | sales of the same equipment to    |
|                                   | professionals. Fortunately, staff |
|                                   | at many sites are accustomed to   |
|                                   | visitors who are serious amateur  |
|                                   | photographers, and realize that   |
|                                   | “professional” equipment isn’t    |
|                                   | what determines commercial        |
|                                   | intent. Many agency staff are     |
|                                   | serious photographers, and        |
|                                   | routinely use such equipment      |
|                                   | themselves. A claim that          |
|                                   | photography is for personal use   |
|                                   | will often not be challenged      |
|                                   | unless circumstances strongly     |
|                                   | suggest otherwise. There are      |
|                                   | exceptions, of course, and in     |
|                                   | such cases, you need to decide    |
|                                   | how far it is worth pushing a     |
|                                   | disagreement.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ### News Photography              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Coverage of breaking news is      |
|                                   | usually protected by the First    |
|                                   | Amendment to the US Constitution, |
|                                   | and accordingly doesn’t require a |
|                                   | permit, but some agencies require |
|                                   | that it be done under supervision |
|                                   | of agency staff to ensure         |
|                                   | adequate protection of site       |
|                                   | resources.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ### Know and Obey the Rules       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Be familiar with the local rules, |
|                                   | and whenever possible, governing  |
|                                   | statutes, ordinances, and         |
|                                   | regulations before arriving at a  |
|                                   | site, and ensure that your        |
|                                   | activity is in compliance with    |
|                                   | the rules. This sometimes         |
|                                   | requires a bit of effort, but     |
|                                   | ignorance of the law may not be   |
|                                   | accepted as an excuse. If you     |
|                                   | follow all the rules, the chances |
|                                   | are good that no one will bother  |
|                                   | you. And if you’re ever           |
|                                   | questioned by agency staff, the   |
|                                   | discussion will usually be more   |
|                                   | productive if it is obvious that  |
|                                   | you know the rules and have made  |
|                                   | all reasonable effort to comply   |
|                                   | with them.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Agency staff aren’t always        |
|                                   | familiar with the laws, and may   |
|                                   | sometimes question a claim that   |
|                                   | you don’t need a permit, so it    |
|                                   | may help to carry printed copy or |
|                                   | know how to quickly access the    |
|                                   | material from a mobile device. In |
|                                   | some cases, this may suffice to   |
|                                   | convince whoever has approached   |
|                                   | you that you’re not doing         |
|                                   | anything that requires a permit.  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sometimes, despite your best      |
|                                   | efforts, you and agency staff may |
|                                   | agree to disagree. If you’re      |
|                                   | certain that you’re correct, it’s |
|                                   | reasonable to be firm in          |
|                                   | asserting your position, but      |
|                                   | always a good idea to be polite   |
|                                   | in doing so, even if you feel     |
|                                   | that you’re being treated         |
|                                   | unfairly or rudely. Although the  |
|                                   | First Amendment protects          |
|                                   | considerable abuse hurled at law  |
|                                   | enforcement personnel, that       |
|                                   | protection may be less honored in |
|                                   | the field than in a courtroom.    |
|                                   | And if you come across as         |
|                                   | belligerent, you may get little   |
|                                   | sympathy from anyone witnessing   |
|                                   | the exchange or watching it later |
|                                   | on                                |
|                                   | [YouTube](https://www.YouTube.com |
|                                   | /).                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If all else fails, asking to      |
|                                   | discuss the situation with a      |
|                                   | supervisor or someone else at the |
|                                   | site’s headquarters who can       |
|                                   | verify the requirements may       |
|                                   | effect a resolution; it probably  |
|                                   | helps if you can point to         |
|                                   | specific material that can be     |
|                                   | readily located.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Common sense should always        |
|                                   | prevail—if the conversation moves |
|                                   | beyond disagreement over the      |
|                                   | rules to “You’re going to get     |
|                                   | cited if you don’t leave,” it may |
|                                   | be better to walk away and return |
|                                   | another time.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If you don’t know the rules,      |
|                                   | you’re obviously rolling the dice |
|                                   | if you push an argument with      |
|                                   | agency personnel. If an alleged   |
|                                   | rule seems ridiculous, it well    |
|                                   | may be. But if you’re wrong,      |
|                                   | things probably will not end      |
|                                   | well. Better to back off, learn   |
|                                   | the rules, and return another     |
|                                   | day. Staff may still disagree     |
|                                   | with you, but at least you’ll     |
|                                   | know whether you’re really doing  |
|                                   | anything wrong.                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ### Avoid Surprising Agency Staff |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Some sites are less accustomed to |
|                                   | serious photographers than        |
|                                   | others. If a site has a staffed   |
|                                   | visitors’ center or entrance      |
|                                   | station, it may help to mention   |
|                                   | your intent to photograph and ask |
|                                   | if the site has any special rules |
|                                   | for photography or if any         |
|                                   | sensitive areas require extra     |
|                                   | precautions; this will ensure     |
|                                   | that you’re apprised of the rules |
|                                   | and of any special restrictions   |
|                                   | such as remaining on trails.      |
|                                   | Although you generally have no    |
|                                   | obligation to do this, agency     |
|                                   | staff will usually appreciate the |
|                                   | consideration; they’ll often try  |
|                                   | to be helpful, and may point out  |
|                                   | photo opportunities that you      |
|                                   | would otherwise miss. In many     |
|                                   | cases, an individual photographer |
|                                   | will not be asked about           |
|                                   | commercial intent, even at places |
|                                   | that nominally require permits.   |
|                                   | At the very least, checking in    |
|                                   | ensures that agency staff are     |
|                                   | aware of your presence, and are   |
|                                   | less likely to panic at another   |
|                                   | visitor’s report that a filming   |
|                                   | crew has invaded the site.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ### No Special Privileges         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Possession of a camera does not   |
|                                   | bestow privileges that are not    |
|                                   | available to the general public.  |
|                                   | If a photographer, professional   |
|                                   | or amateur, requires access to a  |
|                                   | location closed to the public,    |
|                                   | access to a site outside of       |
|                                   | normal visiting hours, or special |
|                                   | assistance from agency staff, a   |
|                                   | permit is usually needed. If you  |
|                                   | exercise privileges that you do   |
|                                   | not possess, you not only are     |
|                                   | asking for trouble, but also risk |
|                                   | creating a bad impression of      |
|                                   | photographers in general.         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | ### Authority for Requiring Permi |
|                                   | ts                                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The authority to require permits  |
|                                   | comes from federal, state, or     |
|                                   | local statutory or administrative |
|                                   | law, and the governing law is the |
|                                   | definitive reference for the      |
|                                   | conditions for which permits may  |
|                                   | be required. In most cases,       |
|                                   | agency policy—either formal or    |
|                                   | perhaps simply stated on a Web    |
|                                   | page—does not have the force of   |
|                                   | law.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Finding the governing law is not  |
|                                   | always a simple matter, however.  |
|                                   | Laws that cover photography       |
|                                   | appear under a variety of general |
|                                   | topics, and are described in      |
|                                   | various ways. Although            |
|                                   | photography is often specifically |
|                                   | mentioned, some agencies simply   |
|                                   | interpret prohibition of          |
|                                   | “commercial activity” as the      |
|                                   | basis for requiring photography   |
|                                   | permits.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If a law is ambiguous, its        |
|                                   | legislative or regulatory history |
|                                   | may help clarify its intent. In   |
|                                   | some cases, a law may be          |
|                                   | ostensibly clear but at odds with |
|                                   | its history or stated purpose; a  |
|                                   | good example is the regulations   |
|                                   | for parks in the [City of Palo    |
|                                   | Alto](#PaloAlto), where it is     |
|                                   | clear that what the law says is   |
|                                   | not what was intended. A similar  |
|                                   | argument could be made for the    |
|                                   | regulations for [California state |
|                                   | parks](#DPR). And perhaps for the |
|                                   | permit requirement in [San        |
|                                   | Francisco parks](#SanFranParks),  |
|                                   | where requiring a permit solely   |
|                                   | for intent to sell seems at odds  |
|                                   | with the purpose of requiring     |
|                                   | permits stated in [Sec.           |
|                                   | 7.01](PermitRegulations.htm#Sec7. |
|                                   | 01)                               |
|                                   | of the San Francisco Park Code.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ultimately, questions of a law’s  |
|                                   | intent, validity, or application  |
|                                   | are matters for the courts to     |
|                                   | decide. But bringing the question |
|                                   | before a court is a significant   |
|                                   | and expensive undertaking, so     |
|                                   | it’s seldom done for              |
|                                   | comparatively trivial matters     |
|                                   | like photography permits.         |
|                                   | Accordingly, a definitive         |
|                                   | interpretation of a questionable  |
|                                   | permit requirement may not be     |
|                                   | available.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Most requirements for local       |
|                                   | agencies are covered in county or |
|                                   | municipal codes, but some         |
|                                   | entities, such as the [City of    |
|                                   | Palo Alto](#PaloAlto), authorize  |
|                                   | certain officials or departments  |
|                                   | to issue regulations without      |
|                                   | formal action by a legislative    |
|                                   | body, so simply searching a code  |
|                                   | may not suffice. If an agency     |
|                                   | claim that permits are required,  |
|                                   | there often is a sound legal      |
|                                   | basis, but discovering that basis |
|                                   | is not always easy. Even agency   |
|                                   | staff, especially at the local    |
|                                   | level, are often unaware of the   |
|                                   | governing laws—but that may not   |
|                                   | stop them from insisting that a   |
|                                   | permit is required.               |
