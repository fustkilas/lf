Large Format Photography: Tachihara cameras

Tachihara cameras
-----------------

**by [Q.-Tuan Luong](http://www.terragalleria.com/) for [the Large
Format Page](.)**

This camera seems to be available under several names, two of them being
Osaka (distributed by Brownwell) and Calumet wood field XM. It is one of
the cheapest fields at less than \$700 (from Adorama in NYC, or Midwest
Photo Exchange). Note that the Brownwell and Calumet versions are more
expensive than the one distributed by Adorama. The only cheaper field
cameras are the old classic cameras and the Graphics, which are
significantly heavier, clumsier, and have much less movements,
therefore, I would tend to say that it is the cheapest reasonnable field
camera.

The design of this camera is quite classical for a double extension
field camera. The only geared control is the front focus. There are
scales for focus and shift (that I find of limited utility). When the
front standard is used in its rail, all the locks are independant. The
lensboards are compatible with Technika's and therefore easy to find new
or used, and quite small. Since you don't need the precise fit of the
Linhof boards, you can get cheap third party boards.

For a photograph of this camera, see figure 4-6 in Ansel Adams book "The
Camera", or check the (highly recommended) book of Steve Simmons "Using
the view camera". It is the wooden field 4x5 of which many pictures are
shown.

Globally, I have found the Tachihara 4x5 to be a very capable
small/lightweight camera and had very little complaints about it. It is
also an excellent value. I sold it only to move to a better 5x7 camera.
As pointed out to by Barry Sherman, the photographer [Ray
McSavaney](http://www.tgartworks.com/mcsavaney), one of the best,
albeit, unfortunately, not best known, large format pictorial (landscape
and architectural, primarily) photographers on the planet, used his
Tachihara for years, including for architectural work.

If you are going to buy a used camera, note the following warning by
Mike Long (mlafly@aol.com):

> a year and a half ago, I didn't have a clue which end to look into.
> So, I didn't know enough to check rigidity of the front and back

### The Tachihara as a 4x5 camera:

-   Like:
    -   The camera is very light, at about 3.8 lbs. The earlier version
        was even lighter at 3.3 lbs. The newer version has brass
        hardware and a sliding back standard, which is useful for wide
        angles and the 5x7 extension. I folds extremely compactly.
    -   It looks beautiful (like most wood fields) with red cherry wood
        and classical brass hardware.
    -   There is a 5x7 extension (more on it latter).
    -   There is a bellows extension (but I have not bought it, so no
        comments).
    -   Due to short and very flexible bellows, it makes a great camera
        for wide-angles. I use a 58mm without need for a recessed
        lensboard, and I can still make some movements, which are back
        tilt and swing. The fact that the camera prevents me from doing
        other movements with this lens is not a drawback for me, since
        the lens that I use (a Rodenstock Grandagon) just covers 4x5.
        With a 90, you can do all the direct front rise/fall available,
        which is a total of 7cm. With a 75, because of bellows
        compression, you can rise or fall of about 2cm each way.
    -   The design is reasonably good. The amount of movements is very
        adequate (tilts of about 30 degrees, swings of 20 degrees,
        rise/fall of 7cm) in particular, by using a combination of tilts
        and shifts, I can reach the coverage limit of the Super Angulon
        120mm.
    -   The ground glass is quite good (better for example than the one
        which comes with the much more expensive Canham): it is a
        plastic ground/fresnel piece protected by a thin sheet of glass,
        and is pretty bright.
-   Limitations:
    -   The camera is not very rigid. If it is windy, it's easier to get
        sharp pictures with my current Canham, for instance.
    -   The front standard: the knobs are too small, and it is a pain to
        set them tight enough, particularly when the front standard is
        used out of its rail (needed to focus at infinity for the 58mm,
        or the 120mm with the 5x7 back)
    -   There is only a double bellows extension (about 33cm), so the
        longest lenses which can be used are about 300mm. The bellows
        are just enough to focus a 300m lens at infinity. I believe that
        one could do better with the older model. One could use a
        backwards axis tilt of the lens combined with a forward base
        tilt to gain the distance needed. The newer model unfortunately
        allow only for a forward axis tilt of the lens so this is not an
        option.

### The 4x5 Tachihara as a 5x7 camera:

For \$300 you can purchase an extension back which replaces the 4x5
back. This back looks like a wooden cone with a 5x7 spring back, weights
1.4 lbs and is rather bulky (more than the camera itself). Wista also
makes these adaptors specifically for the backs of their DX and SP (a
different model for each).

-   Plus: This equipment is the lightest way to get into 5x7, and one of
    the cheapest, apart from using B&J and so on. A B&J costs about the
    same price than the 5x7 back. It weights two times more. The Kodak
    and Corona camera don't have full movements, as well as some
    Deardorffs. The Wisner and Caham are nice but cost \$2500. This 5x7
    combination is lighter than most 4x5 cameras, including the Zone VI
    and the Wisner. You have also a good multi-format ability (an
    important thing for me, since I did not know first which format I
    would prefer). The switch between the 4x5 and 5x7 is almost as fast
    as switching between horizontal and vertical (not taking into
    account the readjustments). You just change the back.
-   Minus: The big drawback is that the internal geometry of the camera
    remains 4x5, thus there is a lot of limitations on the movements and
    long lenses that can be used. The limitations listed are not too bad
    for wide angle landscape photography.
    -   When using short lenses (eg 120), the lens has to be in the
        camera. Therefore, there is no possibility of shifts, plus you
        have to use an awkward front standard configuration, plus the
        tilts are limited to the back. Lenses shorter than 120mm can't
        be focused at infinity due to the box+body+bellows+front
        standard not compressing to the flange focal length.
    -   When using longer lenses, ther problem is that since the
        extension is a cone joining the 5x7 back to a 5x5 square, to
        avoid vignetting by the internal elements of the camera, the
        lens has to lie inside the cone. This is not a problem for the
        large border , but definitely one for the small one. It means:
        no extension longer than 260mm. In particular you cannot even
        use a normal 300m with the 5x7 back (but a 360 telephoto works).
        A 300mm on the 5x7 is the equivalent of a 60mm for a 35mm
        camera, thus this is pretty short.
    -   With tilts, you have to be quite careful to avoid vignetting. I
        have found that with the 120mm (horizontal and moderate
        vertical) it is OK, but with the 210mm I cannot get enough
        vertical tilt in vertical format. Shifts are also extremely
        problematic.
