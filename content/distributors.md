One of the best US distributors is Photomark in Phoenix. See under
"Canham". Other distributors in the US which are said to be reliable are
Badger Graphics (Michigan) and the F-Stops here (Santa Barbara).

I bought my camera from Photomark following John Sparks advice, and have
found Rod to be a nice person to deal with. Phoenix is close to Mesa, so
Rod can expedite things with Keith. For more distributors, ask Keith.
There are many now.
