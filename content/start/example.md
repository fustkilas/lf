[]{#lf}

For landscapes, I prefer [this large format (LF)
camera](../canham/canham.html), because it produces an image which
matches my perception of a visually rich world.

First, because the size of the film is 5x7 inches (12.7cm x 17.8cm), the
camera records an amazing amount of detail, 25 times what is contained
in a regular 135 (24mm x 36mm) frame. Everything which I saw is on the
film, and even more. When I examine my transparencies under a lupe, I
notice from time to time details which escaped me when I was looking at
the scene.

Note that what I display here does not even capture the full detail in
the original transparency, but only a quarter of it: the scanning was
done only at a resolution necessary to produce a 24x30 inches (60 x 75
cm) print, which is 6000 x 9000 pixels. However, the transparency has a
resolution of at least 50 lpm, is 5x7 inches (12.7cm x 17.8cm) and
therefore could have been used to produce a quality digital image file
at least four times larger (12000 x 17000 pixels). Such a file would
have been close to 1 Gigabye. At the resolution used, there is
absolutely no fuzziness and no grain.

Second, the LF camera is not rigid because the lens is connected to the
film plane with a bellows. This let me control the perspective and the
distribution of sharpness in a way which cannot be achieved with a
regular camera:

-   I remember the trees as beeing parallel to each other. The LF camera
    renders them that way. However the camera is looking down since the
    lake fills up more than two-thirds of the frame. With a regular
    camera, this would cause the trees in the background to lean towards
    the edge of the frame, which would not be quite right.
-   I remember each part of the scene with the same clarity. The LF
    camera looks at the close objects sharply and looks at the horizon
    sharply at the same time: notice that the grass in the foreground,
    only a few feet in front of the camera, is seen as clearly as the
    distant trees. In contrast, a regular camera has to focus either
    close or far.

For this particular photograph, those adjustments were quite simple and
intuitive. It was getting dark fast. I didn't want to make the
photograph in full daylight, because I knew that the colors would be
lost to the contrast, and instead I chose to wait for the quiet and soft
light of dusk. After leveling the camera, I lowered the lens using front
fall to obtain the composition I wanted. I then tilted the lens, which
tilts the plane of sharp focus, until it became horizontal. I was lucky
that day because the air was quite still, so even in the 15 second
exposure (necessitated by the f 22 aperture and the slow speed of Fuji
Velvia), there was only minimal blurring of the grasses.
