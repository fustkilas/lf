Introduction: History of the Graphic and Graflex Cameras
--------------------------------------------------------

There is a tendency for the name \`\`Speed Graphic'' to be used to
denote any \`\`press'' style camera. The Speed Graphic was manufactured
by Graflex, a Rochester, New York based camera producer. It was the
dominant portable professional camera from the 1930's through the end of
the 1950's.

The Speed Graphics and their brethren, the \`\`Crown Graphic'' and
\`\`Century Graphic\`' are remarkable cameras capable of the highest
quality of work. The Speed Graphic has not been manufactured since 1973
and most photographers today are unable to make a direct comparison\*.
In many ways, the Speed Graphic was America's first and last great
camera.

The Speed Graphic was engineered for general purpose commercial
photography such as wedding, portaiture, product, documentary,
advertising and landscape photography. Otha Spencer writes in
Shutterbug,

> After the war, I bought a Pacemaker Speed Graphic and started a
> commercial and portrait studio. With the Speed Graphic, a 4x5 Super-D
> Graflex, one reflector flood light, one background light and a
> primitive darkroom, I became a commercial photographer.

The Speed Graphic camera has two shutters - focal plane and in-lens;
three viewfinders - optical, wire frame and ground glass;
interchangeable lenses; a rise and fall front; lateral shifts; a coupled
rangefinder; and a double extension bellows adaptable to lenses from
90mm to over 300mm.

The Speed Graphic looks complicated, but is a one of the simplest and
most flexible cameras made. Afflicted by a \`\`Rube Goldberg'' variety
of features - three viewfinders! - you prove your skill everytime you
use it. Nothing in the Graphic is automated; if you don't pay attention
you can double expose, shoot blanks, fog previous exposures or shoot out
of focus images. However, once you get used to it, it is amazingly easy
to use.

The older Graflex SLR with its patented focal plane shutter and reflex
focusing had been so successful as a press camera that the Graflex
company set out to design a camera specifically for the emerging
\`\`press'' photographer. The result was the original Speed Graphic of
1912.

The concept of having two separate shutters was a new idea. The focal
plane shutter was the same as used in the Graflex, the front in-lens
shutter provided extra versatility. Because both shutters can not be
used at the same time, there is possibility of confusion. Experienced
Speed Graphic users find selection of shutters second nature.

In 1940, Graflex announced the Anniversary Speed Graphic with Kodak
Anastigmat (or the then all-new Ektar) lens. The new features included
the coupled rangefinder and flash solenoid to use the then popular
flashbulb. The bed would drop past horizontal, allowing the use of the
then new wide angle lenses.

The Speed Graphic was the still camera of World War II, and took many
famous images striking today for their technical and artistic beauty. On
the home front, Arthur Fellig, aka. Weegee, prowled the streets of New
York with his Speed Graphic. He writes in his 1945 monograph Naked City:

> The only camera I use is a 4x5 Speed Graphic with a Kodak Ektar lens
> in a Supermatic Shutter. All-American made. The film I use is Kodak
> Super-Panchro Press B. I always use a flashbulb for my pictures which
> are mostly taken at night...
> If you are puzzled about the kind of camera to buy, get a Speed
> Graphic.... for two reasons.... it is a good camera, and moreover....
> with a camera like that the cops will assume that you belong on the
> scene and will let you get behind police lines.

In 1947, the Pacemaker Speed Graphic was introduced bristling with new
features such as a body mounted shutter release and simplified focal
plane shutter (now with 6 normal speeds rather than the 24 speeds
possible before).

The \`\`Graflok'' back, with a metal focusing hood and removable ground
glass was introduced in 1949. This back, the standard for 4x5" view
cameras today accepts sheet film holders, roll film adaptors, the now
obsolete film pack, cut film magazines (the Grafmatic) and the Polaroid
back.

The Speed Graphic, like other \`\`press'' cameras is designed to be
operated either handheld or on a tripod. In this sense, there is a
kinship between the Speed Graphic and 35mm gear. In the larger format
world \`\`kinship to 35mm'' can not be considered equivalence of
features or toys. The 4x5" Speed Graphic could not be farther from
modern 35mm gear in terms of construction or configuration. Yet with a
Grafmatic one can go shoot six successive images handheld using shutter
speeds as high as 1/1000 sec.

The company name changed several times over the years as it was absorbed
and then released by the [Kodak](http://www.kodak.com/) empire, finally
becoming a division of the Singer Corporation and then dissolved in
1973. The award winning Graflex plant in suburban Pittsford, New York is
still standing and is home to the MOSCOM Corporation.

than antique or collectible cameras. The Speed Graphic was manufactured
in a number of sizes, 4x5" being the most common, but also in 2.25x3.25"
3.25x4.25" and 5x7"

[]{#Where}

Where to Get a Speed Graphic?
-----------------------------

Since we are talking about 30-50 year old equipment, you can't buy one
at your local K-Mart. The best way to find a Speed Graphic or related
camera is to purchase a copy of Shutterbug Magazine and peruse the ads,
or visit your local camera flea market.

Recent prices vary widely from \$300 and up for a beat Speed Graphic to
\$150 for a Crown Graphic in great shape with Kodak 127mm f4.7 lens,
filters, 11 normal 4x5 film holders; 1 4x5 film pack adaptor, flash,
bulbs, and case. []{#Similar}

### Similar cameras by other manufacturers

The Wista 45RF and Linhof Master Technica are more suitable for
\`\`Press'' camera use than the others, as both have range finders. The
Wista has a revolving back (a la the Super Graphic). While the Linhof is
similar to the Pacemaker Crown Graphics, and it has much more movement
available and any \`\`Press'' Graphic did.

The Toyo 45a Field Camera (\$1550) and Horseman 45FA Camera (\$2700) are
also similar. There are other 4x5 Field Cameras, but they are more of
the classic wood box tradition, and are generally not constructed so as
to be suitable for hand-holding.

[]{#LensBuying}

Lens Buying Guide

Lenses for a 4x5" are specialized.

The major American view camera lens manufacturers are Kodak, Wollensak
(OEM supplier for Graflex), and Ilex. Bausch and Lomb was a manufacturer
in the pre-war period. Other common manufacturers are Carl Zeiss Jena,
Schneider-Kreuznach and Meyer-Goerz-Optik.

In discussing the various post WWII coated lenses mention should also be
given to German suppliers. Due to manufacturing, supply, and legal
problems, there were relatively few post-war Zeiss Tessars made.

You can group view camera lenses into 4 broad categories:

1.  ### General Purpose lenses

    For work 4'-infinity - mostly older lenses, these are usually of the
    \`\`tessar'' type and can be fairly fast (f/4.5)

      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Kodak, Schneider, Wollensak made lenses of approximately the same
    focal length. Thus there are equivalent choices in a given focal
    length between a Ektar, Xenar or Optar.

    Most Graflex Optars are made by Wollensak, but later (post 1965)
    Optars are manufactured by Rodenstock.

    These lenses are 3 group/4 element "Tessar" type lenses with a 55
    degree circle. The Ektars were probably the best all around quality,
    with Xenars next, and Raptars and Acutars third. They are fairly
    close if in good repair and not mistreated.

    The Polaroid 110,110A and 110B roll-film cameras can often be found
    very inexpensively. They are fitted either with a Rodenstock Ysarex
    127/4.5 or Wollensak Rapter 127/4.5.

2.  ### Non Tessar Type General Purpose Lenses

    Non Tessar type - usually 3/5 type - post war lenses of superb
    quality include the Voigtlander Heliars and Apo-Lanthars, the
    Schneider Xenotar and the Zeiss Planar. However, they are extremely
    expensive for a lens with a 50-degree image circle.

3.  ### Symmetrical (wide field) lenses

    Useful for closeup and landscape work.

    #### Notes About Symmetrical Lenses

    -   Schneider Symmar

        Symmars (coated, post-WWII) come in 100, 135, 150, 180 and 210,
        all in Syncho Compurs. Even though these are "convertible", they
        are poor when used that way. Later 'Symmar S's from the 70s,
        more expensive, have even better coating and wider circle of
        illumination, but are much more expensive. However the Symmars
        are still excellent lenses.

    -   Kodak WF Ektars

        The two Kodak WF Ektars need to be stopped down considerably to
        equal in sharpness to the General Purpose Tessar lenses
        mentioned the the first section when used as wide-angle lenses.
        They are less even in illumination across the same field of view
        in comparision to a Symmar. Sharper at wide apertures than the
        90mm Angulon, etc. The 135mm WF Ektar was reccomended for
        General Purpose use on 4x5 monorail view cameras..

    -   90mm Wollensak W/A, Graflex

        The Graflex W/A Optar, really a Wollensak Raptar W/A is another
        older wide-angle lens. Acceptibly sharp when stopped down, f/6.8
        is for focusing only. Use at f/11-32. Of similar design to WF
        Ektar.

    -   Kodak Ektar 203mm

        The Kodak Ektar, 203mm/f7.7, has a 50 degree angle of coverage.
        It is a very old 4-element air-spaced design and has remarkable
        sharpness from infinity to close up. Being slow, f/7.7, it is
        fairly small and light. Sharpest wide-open.

    -   Dagor/Angulon
        The Dagor and the Schneider Angulon are true symmetricals (f6.8)
        but can cover over 70 degrees at f22 and 80 degrees at f45. They
        are of six-element, two-group construction. With so few
        air-glass interfaces they are resistant to flare - uncoated
        Dagors will be acceptible.

4.  ### Extreme Wide Angle lenses

      Name                      Focal Length   Aperture
      ------------------------- -------------- ----------
      Schneider Super Angulon   90mm           f/8
      Schneider Super Angulon   90mm           f/5.6
      Schneider Super Angulon   65mm           f/8
      Rodenstock Grandagon                     
      Zeiss Biogon                             

    These lenses are much more expensive than any lens in either the
    General Purpose or Symmetrical category sections. This is especially
    ture for the Biogons which are magnificent but totally out of sight
    in terms of \$.

5.  ### Special effects lenses

    -   Telephoto

        These long focal length lenses are not ususally hand-held.

          Name                 Focal Length   Aperture   Shutter
          -------------------- -------------- ---------- --------------------------------
          Graflex Tele-Optar   270mm          f6.5       (Graflex-1000, 1/1000 shutter)
          Graflex Tele-Optar   380mm (15")    f/5.6      (barrel)
          Graflex Tele-Optar   250mm (10")    f/5.6      (barrel)

        The lenses list are only a small selection of what is available.
        Telephoto lenses have a small image circle and use
        proportionally less bellows draw than their focal length
        suggests. The only way to get 380mm of lens onto a Speed
        Graphic.

        Generally this type of lens does not really allow for movements
        on a 4x5. But this issue of what lenses for what purposes on a
        4x5 is a much broader issue not really appropriate to go into
        further in this FAQ.

    -   Soft Focus

          Name
          -------------------
          Rodenstock Imagon

A used Graphic will typically be found fitted with a General Purpose
lens. The Kodak Ektar or Graflex Optar are common. These vintage lenses
(127mm Ektar, 135mm Optar) do not have sufficient coverage to allow the
use of movements when focused at infinity.

**Beware** : Sharpness falls off much faster than illumination.

When checking out an older shutter note that there are separate springs
for slow(&lt;1/30), medium and high speeds (over 1/250). Check all
speeds and exercise the shutter. If you desire to use a flash, be sure
to check for flash synchronization. 'X' mode is for electronic flashes,
while 'M' mode is for flash bulbs, there may be other synchronization
positions on the switch. Many camera repair shops can clean and check
shutters for accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Notes about the Ektar Lenses

Ektars are generally considered to have better QC than the Optars.

Kodak's professional lens line was labelled "Ektar" beginning around
1940. There are a few Ektars to be found on roll film camera, the
art-deco Bantam Special had a six element f/2.0 50mm Ektar, and used 828
roll film. The better-than-Leica Kodak Ektra used an array of Ektar
lenses. And the solid-as-a-tank Kodak Medalist used a 5-element f/3.5
100mm Ektar.

The 105/3.7 is similar to the 100/3.5 Medalist Ektar, a fine lens of the
Heliar type.

The 100/4.5 and 152/4.5 are solid performers.

The 127/4.7, the word comes from Kodak insiders, was the best corrected
on axis. Though nominally a lens for 3.25x4.25 press cameras, it is
fairly common on 4x5" Speed Graphics. I've found it to work admirably on
4x5" w/o movements.

The 203/7.7 is similar to the old Kodak Anastigmats from the 1920's. It
is a 4-air-spaced element design. It is symmetrical. It holds
corrections quite well even in extreme closeups.

### Notes about Ilex Lenses

Ilex was based in Rochester, NY. They originally produced older Kodak
designs and rather large shutters.

1950's Ilex Paragons were typically coated versions of the 1940's Kodak
Anastigmat f/4.5 (tessar type).

I'm rather uncertain of what hapened to them later on, I too have seen
Ilex branded lenses similar to formula to the Super Angulon.

[]{#LensStorage}

### Lens Storage

It is generally recommended that lenses be stored set to their lowest
speeds, or 'T' (when available), as this leaves the springs in an
uncompressed state.

Camera Movements: How Much Is Enough?
-------------------------------------

It depends.

The Speed Graphic is not really a view camera: you can't tie it up into
a pretzel. Depending on the sort of photography one is interested in,
this may or may not be limiting. The rigidity of the Graphics make them
very useful for high-speed, wide-aperture shooting (the sort of shot
where extreme depth of field is not important). If you are interested in
a 4x5" to pursue photography suitable for 35mm or 2-1/4" equipment, the
motions are an extra, not an essential. There are other large format
photographers who disagree, their personal vision requires the use of
considerable amounts of perspective control.

To utilize movements, the photographer must use a lens that has ample
reserve covering power. In the vintage lens field, the 135mm WF Ektar,
the 120mm Angulon, or the longish 203mm f/7.7 Ektar are possibilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#Features}

Features
--------

[]{#Focusing}

### Focusing Back

The pop-open focusing back can usually be removed from the holder by two
clips on the side. This exposes the ground glass retaining clips. The
preferable set-up is to have a fresnel lens as with out it the image
when viewed will get darker as you one views from the center out to the
corners.

Always remember to watch the corners !

If you have a fresnel lens (circular grid on the glass), and the corners
are darker than the center, then you may have adjusted the camera in
such a way that the lens is not covering the area of the film plane.
Many of the standard 'Graflex' lens cover the area of a 4"x5" sheet, but
not much more. Wide angle and wide field lenses should be clearly marked
with WA or WF, indicating they have a greater coverage area than the
diameter of the lens.

Also remember to switch from preview to shutter mode, and stop down the
lens as necessary before pulling the dark slide.

Depending on lighting, you may find a magnifier and dark cloth or light
coat handy (to block out light while focusing on the screen).
[]{#Infinity}

### Infinity Stops

The infinity stops are small tabs which fold over and are located within
the rails, held in place by two extremely small screws. By folding over
the tabs, the lens can pass by the Infinity Stop, which allows one to
use multiple infinity stops, one for each different focal length lens.

With the rails adjusted to the rear of the bed, and the lens focused on
infinity, you may set the infinity stops for each particular lens.

### Focusing Scales

Focusing Scales are attached to a moving portion of the sliding rails,
and to a fixed portion of the bed, in front of the lens. The scales,
depending on the lens, will generally have alignment marks for intervals
from 6 to 25 feet, as well as 50, 100 and Infinity. []{#Viewfinders}

### Viewfinders

Cheesey Viewfinder 
:   Parallax adjustable, with various templates for different lenses.
    Subject too small to see details while viewing.

Hoop Viewfinder 
:   Parallax adjustable, allows viewing of the subject while taking
    pictures.

Kalart Rangefinders 
:   Side (steel) or Top (plastic) rangefinder which is connected to the
    moving rails, see below.

[]{#FocalPlane}

### Speed Graphics: The Focal Plane Shutter

In a genuine Speed Graphic the focal plane shutter is the only part that
might be trouble, but is reliable and there are shops dedicated to
fixing them.

Because of the Speed Graphic's focal plane shutter, is slightly heavier
than the similar Crown Graphic, also the depth required for a focal
plane shutter may preclude the user of certain very-wide-angle lens
(below 80mm), where a Crown Graphic may be able to use a 65mm WA lens.

The focal plane shutters operate as a curtain with different sized
openings, and can be set to two speeds with three different openings,
producing speeds of 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, 1/500, and 1/1000. Most
lenses with internal shutters will have speeds up to 1/400 or 1/500,
while the Graflex-1000 goes to 1/1000 seconds, there are some some older
ones only go as high as 1/200.

Be careful to know when the curtain is open and closed, as mis-use of
the focal plane shutter will keep film from being exposed (if you're
using a lens shutter), or leaving the curtain open (such as for
focusing) will fog film, if exposed to it.

An advantage of having a focal plane shutter is that you can also use
barrel lenses (w/o a shutter). A 15" (380mm) Graflex Optar Telephoto, in
a barrel mount is much less expensive (\~\$90) than the equivalent in a
shutter, which seem to go for \$250-300. Also, many vintage (1920-30's)
soft focus portrait lenses are only available in barrel.

Use of a slow speed focal plane shutter should produce noticeable "lean"
when you pan to follow moving objects.

Are the large focal plane shutters accurate ?

I checked mine out. 1/1000 sec is dead on. Your average modern SLR it is
probably no more accurate. []{#KalartSide}

### Kalart Side Mounted Range Finder \[Up to 1955\]

Side mounted Kalart rangefinders without interchangeable cams, can be
adjusted for a particular lens, if the proper (tedious) procedure is
followed.

Operation: The two images in the Kalart are the same color. The split
portion shows up as a center spot. This may become more apparent if you
place a colored piece of gel in front of one of the openings to the
Kalart. \[If the half silver mirror is abraised or otherwise lost
silvering, this image may be very faint.\] In general bring the split
image into alignment, and if the camera is in focus through-out the
scale, then the rangefinder is cammed or adjusted to the lens. Here are
some instructions for adjusting the Kalart.

#### Adjusting the Kalart Rangefinder

The following 4 steps are to be followed in adjusting the Kalart
Rangefinder

1.  Check focus of lens at infinity - if necessary re-adjust infinity
    stops
2.  Set Rangefinder for infinity
3.  Adjust Rangefinder for 15ft
4.  Adjust Rangefinder for 4ft.

<!-- -->

1.  **Checking Focus of Lens at infinity**\
    The 1st step in synchronizing the RF is to establish the correct
    infinity position for the lens - if necessary relocating the camera
    infinity stops.

    Use a tall building, chimney, etc. at least 1/2 mile away as a
    target.

    Note: on Pacemaker Graphic (incl. Century) cameras - the track must
    be racked forwards to bring the image into focus at infinity.

2.  **Setting RF for infinity**\
    1st remove the cover over the RF, exposing the innards. In the event
    the RF is out of adjustment re-set it as follows: the infinity
    adjustment is made by turning the eccentric screw attacked to the
    rear of the right runner of the camera track. (this is where the
    long lever from the RF on the inside of the bed contacts the
    focusing track). You can use a dime to turn this screw. (the screw
    becomes visible when the track is raked very far forwards).
3.  **Adjusting 15ft.**\
    Focus the camera on something approximately 15ft away. use a
    magnifier to make absolutely certain of the sharpness of the image.
    to adjust, adjust the rear scale (loosen screw which protrudes
    through a slot immediately above the words "to loosen &lt;- -". this
    is a left-hand thread!! move the indicator on the rear scale. then
    tighten.

    Repeat the infinity check! (this may take several iterations)

4.  **Adjusting 4ft.**\
    Focus the camera to approximately 4 ft. to adjust loosen the two
    screws which hold the indexed slider on the front of the rangefinder
    and slide the indicator to adjust. retighten screws.

Repeat the infinity check! and 15ft.

[]{#KalartTop}

### Kalart Top Mounted Range Finder \[1955 and later\]

Featuring interchangeable cams and Parallax Correction.

The cams are tricky to locate and are set up for specific lenses (a
caveat if your camera has a mismatched cam).

### Graflok Back \[1949 and later\]

The \`\`Graflok Back'' is a feature which IS desirable, and is a
relatively \`\`late'' enhancement to the Graphic line of camera. These
have the removable focus panel and locks to hold various filmbacks.

[]{#Accessories}

Accessories
-----------

-   Graphic \`\`Riteway'' Film Holders\
    Back Type: Standard
-   Standard 2 sheet film holders. \[Used: \~\$10. each\]
-   Grafmatic Film Holders\
    (4x5 model: Cat. 1268)\
    Back Type: Standard

    The Grafmatic holder (not to be confused with the Graphic Pack Film
    holders), will hold size sheets of film in one container. The sheets
    are held in individual steel widgets referred to as \`\`septums.''
    As of early 1994, the going prices were advertised as high as
    \$80-\$120, but many individuals report sale prices less than that
    for holders in good condition.

    It is reported they made Grafmatic's for the older Graphics, which
    have a slot instead of ridges for a light-trap on the film-plane
    side, buyer beware. Also, watch out for bent film holders, and don't
    force the septums in or out. Try practicing loading and unloading in
    the light, with spent film or developed sheets to get the hang of
    it.

    They aren't difficult to use, but there are some subtleties in the
    loading.

    Once you put a negative up front, and pull the slide it will be set
    to take the photo because when you put the slide back it, it will be
    behind the front one, and then it drops to the back. Thus, if you
    prepare the Grafmatic for use, and then decide to re-frame or
    whatever, the unexposed negative is still up front. Leave the holder
    in the camera and cycle through the septums, back to the one you
    were on except don't pull the darkslide on it. That way it's back on
    top, but not exposed.

-   Graphic Film Pack Adapter (Cat. 1234) Back Type: Graflok

    Operation and packaging seem similar to a Polaroid Pack Film back.

    4"x5" 16 Exposure Pack Film (Tri-X, etc.) is no longer available.

-   Roll Film Backs Back Type: Graflok (usually)

    There were 3 negative sizes, RH-8 (2.25" sq), RH-10 (2.25x2.75") and
    RH-8 (2.25x3.25") and holders were made for 2.25x3.25,3.25x4.25 and
    4x5" cameras with either Graflock or Graflex backs. Early film
    holders, with the knob wind do not hold modern film flat, it bowes
    approx. 3/32" towards the film - blowing focus at shallow f/stops.

    It seems that lever wind units have the rollers and the knob wind
    version do not.

    A conversation with WD Service about this revealed that there were
    no roller types made for 3x4. The problem may be subtle, hard to
    deduce at first because you figure it was just field curvature or
    some aberration.

    It also seems that there's a slight overall difference in the film
    plane between my non-roller and roller versions (at least sometimes)
    - but they measure the same. May be an artifact of the same problem.

    Also, Horseman has current production Graflok roll-film holders,
    while Calument sells non-Graflok roll film holders.

-   Polaroid Back\
    Back Type: Standard

    Three flavors exist.

      ------- -------------------------------------------------------------
      405     3.25x4.25 pack film
      550     4x5" pack film
      545i    4x5" sheet film (ABS plastic, lighter, supposedly improved)
      (545)   4x5" sheet film (steel/brass, black enamel)
      ------- -------------------------------------------------------------

    **Warning:**Avoid the Type 500 sheet film holder, which was last
    made in 1969 and is incompatible with current film. It won't engage
    the dark slide catch.

    An advantage of the 545(i) sheet film holders are that they allow
    you to choose any film for any shot, and not be stuck with the same
    film for a full pack (8 or 10 shots). Useful if you're shooting 100
    then 400, and want to use the same speed test Polaroid. Ditto for
    color vs. B&W.

-   Miscellaneous Cases, either civilian or military (O.D. Green).
    -   Ex. 10"x14"x20", velvet lined
-   Flashes, either civilian (chrome) or military (matt black).

Recommendations
---------------

-   Do your own B&W processing & darkroom work.
-   Use Polaroids while learning, and then check framing, exposure,
    corners, etc.
-   For color work, shoot chromes instead of negs and let them be their
    own proofs. You can make prints from the ones you like and chromes
    are much easier to sell to traditional publishers than negs.
