Review of Gowland Pocket Camera
-------------------------------

**By [Jared Radin](mailto:jradin@mindspring.com) for [the Large Format

**SUMMARY:**

I have used the Gowland Pocket Camera for several months, and so far I'm
very happy with it. I do a lot of hiking and travel, so size and weight
are extremely important to me. I've made a few simple modifications to
the camera and I have learned how to better use the camera with time. I
am not an "expert" so as with everything on the Internet, please take
all opinions with a grain of salt. I am interested in feedback, so
please let me know if you have a differing or the same opinion.

**DESCRIPTION:**

Notes about the camera design.

-   Many of the movements depend on the specific features ordered.
-   Loosening the two bolts on the side on the lensboard allows rise,
    fall, and tilt. The same bolt allows replacement of the lensboard.
-   Swings and shift are obtained by loosening the bolt with the large
    metal handle on front standard (The handle is barely visible in
    second picture).
-   The handle at the back of the camera allows rear tilt.
-   The film back can be moved into a horizontal or vertical position by
    loosening four screws in the rear frame .
-   The standard MONORAIL consists of one or two 8" tubes. The front
    tube has a grove for the focusing mechanism.

**STRENGTHS:**

-   Reasonable cost of around \$600, but it's gone up to \$700.
-   Light weight, 2.75 Pounds (more details follow)
-   Small size, approx. 6" x 8" x 2.75" (more details follow).
-   Especially for it's weight, if feels very solid and rigid.
-   Friction focusing feels good.
-   Tilts, swings, etc. are easy to adjust.
-   There is a greater range of movements than with many folding field
    cameras.
-   With the exception of the groundglass and bellows the camera is 100%
    metal, mostly aluminum, so the camera should withstand a lot of
    abuse.
-   If you are mechanically inclined, it's relatively easy to make
    design changes (replacing Allen head screws with hand-turnable
    screws, etc.).

**WEAKNESSES:**

-   Many items I consider to be weaknesses can be eliminated by making
    at least some of simple changes outlined in the next section.
-   I feel changing the back between vertical and horizontal is a bit
    clumsy. The back is held on by four screws, which need to be
    loosened for the back to be repositioned.
-   Getting the camera into neutral positions is not fool proof as on
    other cameras. The camera does not snap into any of the neutral
    positions and they are not marked. When assembling the camera one
    needs to always visually check the front rise/fall, front tilt, rear
    tilt, and rotation (on the monorail axis) of the camera back
    relative to the front of the camera, and the front swing/shift. In
    my opinion a small price to pay to save a few pounds.

**WEAKNESSES WHICH CAN EASILY BE FIXED BY THE SEMI-MECHANICALLY
INCLINED:**

-   On the rear block, I replaced the Allen head bolt with a levered
    bolt Peter Gowland mailed me. Now I can detach/attach the back of
    the camera to the monorail without a tool. To me it's well worth the
    \$10 and the extra weight (probably less than 1/2 oz.).
-   On the focusing block I replaced an Allen head screw with a screw
    with a small knob so it can be turned by hand. Now I can adjust the
    friction without a tool.
-   This applies especially if you use a 210mm to 300mm lens. Instead of
    an 8.5" tube I strongly recommend special ordering a tube longer
    than the focal length of your longest lens if it will fit in your
    camera case. For a 210mm lens I've been much happier since ordering
    a 10.5" tube, which allows me to focus to about 7 feet. (a 12" tube
    would have been better if it had fit in my camera case). To me
    connecting the two 8.5" monorail tubes is clumsy. It's especially
    clumsy if the camera is already set up with a single tube for wide
    angle shooting, and you switch to a longer lens. I don't mind
    connecting the two tubes for the rare close-up shot with my 210mm
    lens.
-   Neutral positions are not marked. Setting up is easier after I
    marked the neutral position for rise/fall on the front standard.
-   Had a MAJOR problem with the focusing block. One screw came out.
    Tightened the other three screws and then could not insert the
    monorail in the focusing block! Went to a good hardware store and
    got four longer screws, and reassembled putting a washer under the
    brass strip between the focusing block and screw heads. This solved
    the problem. This is the only example I found of sloppy workmanship
    and/or design, leaving the screws very loose so focusing will work.
    Since then I got a new 10.5" monorail, and I had to remove the
    washers, and leave the screws slightly loose. Since the replacement
    screws were longer than the originals, I've had no problems, even
    without the washers. I'm planning to get some very thin washers.
-   I suggest that camera owners assemble a spare part kit of each of
    the small screws that could fell out. Most of the screws cost about
    20 cents. A trip to Ace hardware and/or Home Depot resulted in
    usable parts, but I a large local hardware store might have a better
    selection of parts. The only screws I've had problems with are the
    four holding the camera back on for V/H adjustment (replaced three
    screws) and the small screws on the focusing block (replaced one,
    and none after replacing with longer screws). There is potential for
    a few other screws and knobs getting loose. In all my cases of lost
    screws, the camera was usable even if the screw replacement had been
    delayed, and the lost screws were sometimes found in the bottom of
    the camera case.
-   To save on cost the camera does not have a grid on the ground glass.
    Mr. Gowland suggested penciling in a grid with a pencil on the dull
    side of the ground glass.

**CUSTOMIZATIONS FEW WOULD WANT, MAY ADD CONSIDERABLY TO THE COST, OR
ARE MINOR.**

-   A company that took over Graflex makes the camera back, and the back
    has been on the market for at least fifty years, so it's a solid
    design. But to me, with four screws to adjust, changing between V/H
    is very rough compared with my Tachiera camera.
-   A customization a few lightweight freaks would desire would be to
    make the camera thinner by offering a 12" bellows instead of the 16"
    bellows and/or making the bellows out of an expensive thinner
    material.
-   The camera is small enough as is, but too me, it would be nice if
    the camera when packed could be made a little smaller by easily
    rotating or removing the rear block.

**WEIGHT:**

**SIZE:**

This gets complicated, as there are several ways of measuring the size.

-   6 x 6.25 x 2.75 is the size quoted to me by Peter Gowland.
-   6 x 9 x 2.75 is my measurement for the basic camera. The additional
    measurement is due to small projections including (a) four screws
    sticking out to allow V/H adjustments. (b) Two projections allowing
    easier lifting of the film back when inserting film holders. (c) Two
    2" (semi-removable) blocks that attach the camera to the monorail.
-   It seems to take up far less room in the camera case than my
    measurements would indicate, as even though a 6" x 9" x 2.75" box is
    necessary for the camera, other accessories can be stored within
    this volume. Also if the rear and front blocks are unscrewed (which
    in my opinion is difficult), it can be made darn close to 6" x 6.25"
    x 2.75", a few thin 8" tubes, and the three small blocks.
