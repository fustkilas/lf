    CAUTION:   The following posting challenges some cherished notions.

    CAUTION:   This is *really* long.

    NOTE:      At times below I'll "quote" Bruce Barnbaum.  Mostly these
               aren't precise quotes but are used to try to capture the spirit of 
               what he said and how he said it.


    I just returned from a 5.5 day workshop with Bruce Barnbaum and Don
    Kirby.  Since there are occasional queries about good workshops to
    attend, I thought I'd do a big write-up about this one.  I'm not going
    to go into great detail about techniques as I think that attending the
    workshop, or at the very least buying Bruce's book, will be of more
    benefit than the sketchy details that I could discuss here.

    Cost:   $475 + $75 lab fee.  I understand that the lab fee is going up to
            $150 as of now.  This cost is exclusive of lodging, food and 
            transportation and inclusive of use of Bruce's outstanding darkroom,
            equipped with 7 Saunders 4500 enlarger.  Lodging 
            at the nearby Mountain View Inn runs $20 per night if you're willing to    
            room with someone (recommended as there are 12 students in the workshop
            and only 6 rooms at the motel, the only motel around).  I, however, 
            made it known that I really wanted a private room and was able to have 
            one.  (thereby saving some poor soul from utter exhaustion from being 
            kept awake by my snoring  :-)  This made my lodging $40 per night.
            The lab fee includes all the 8x10 Kodak Elite paper that you want to 
            use during the lab sessions.

            Come to think of it, there are camp grounds nearby and people with
            campers are welcome to stay on their grounds and use their shower.

    Where:  At Bruce's home in the Northern Cascade mountains in Washington
            state.  He lives outside of Granite Falls.  Beautiful location.
            People flew and drove in from California, Michigan, Texas, Nebraska,
            Arizona, New Jersey and, even, Washington (state).

    Title:  "Complete Photographic Process"  Bruce does many workshops.  This
            one is devoted to black/white photography from exposure of the
            negative to mounting/spotting of the print.  Although there are
            3 field sessions during which you can expose film, and darkroom
            time allotted to negative development, students are encouraged
            to bring negatives with them, especially "problem negatives",
            so as to be able to rework old images under the instructors'
            tutelege.  Printing in his great darkroom using Saunders 4500
            enlargers with Dichro heads is a promiment feature of the workshop.

            BTW - this was my first actual use of the Saunders.  Great enlarger.  
            Nice bright bulb, easy to use controls, very, very rigid and all around
            a pleasure to use.  If I get a second enlarger I'll give very serious 
            thought to this one.

    When:   Four times per year - Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall.

    Who they are: 
    --- ---- ----

      Bruce Barnbaum is one of the world's most highly acclaimed b/w landscape 
      photographers.  His work is available in galleries throughout the U.S.  I 
      was interested to learn that he has made stunning color (Ilfochrome) images 
      as well.  If "money is the most sincere form of appreciation", then 
      consider:  his UNlimited edition 16x20's now command $750 and his limited 
      edition 20x24's go for $2,500.
      
      But if you don't believe in price as a measure of one's work, then:
     
      He showed us his work every evening after dinner.  Beyond belief.  This guy 
      is incredibly good.  Image after stunning image after exquisite image.  He 
      showed us between 80 and 100 prints throughout the course of the workshop 
      and, while some were not really to my personal taste, the quality was always 
      wonderful.  One might say "What is this?  I pay hundreds of dollars to stare 
      at someone else's photography?" But these "exhibitions" involved lots of 
      questions and discussion ranging from technique to philosophy and were 
      highly worthwhile.  And just plain interesting.  Some of his anecdotes about 
      photographing in slit canyons (and just missing a horrendous flash flood)
      were fascinating and downright frightening.  And I can't wait to hike the 
      length of Buckskin Gulch!
      
      Bruce is one of the most dynamic people I've ever encountered.  He seems
      to bring an enormous passion to everything he does.  I'm certain that
      this is a large part of the reason for his success.  It doesn't matter 
      whether he's exposing film, printing, listening to classical music, 
      fighting the proposed quarry which may destroy his lovely community or 
      fighting the clear-cutting which is destroying so much forest habitat. 
      Whatever he does, he does with every fiber of his being.  At some times I 
      found his intensity somewhat off-putting but at the same time I developed 
      great admiration and respect for him.  Plus, he has an inexhaustable supply 
      of really great jokes and anecdotes, which he shares at every opportunity.  
      Incredible supply of "groaners".  Really terribly funny "groaners".  :-)  
      E.g:  "You gotta pity poor David Koresh.  All his life he wanted to be a 
      priest but in the end he was only a friar."  All together now:  
      Grrrooooooaaaaaannnnn.  :-)

      Don Kirby is, perhaps, less well known but is a marvelous photographer as 
      well.  Similarly, every evening he showed us his work and it was humbling.  
      His interests seem to be largely Anasazi ruins, which he's explored
      extensively for the last 10 or more years, wheat fields in their 
      infinite variety of form, and abstract patterns in rock.  Don is more
      laid back but I detect a passion for the natural world as deep as
      Bruce's.  Don's printing, like Bruce's, combines the bold with the subtle
      in a wonderfully expressive way.  Like Bruce, he's an excellent teacher,
      able to explain the complex, patient and genuinely interested in helping
      people to grow.

      I'm impressed with Don in another way.  He not too long ago realized
      a 10 year goal:  early retirement and delving completely into his
      photography.  For the last decade he's worked at building a body of work
      and taken much time off from work without pay in order to photograph and
      to assist other photographers in teaching their workshops.  He is now
      co-instructor of this workshop and others with Bruce and will be leading
      his own in the near future (exploring Anasazi ruins in So. Utah).  I'm
      really happy to see as good a person as Don being able to realize his
      dreams.

      All in all, two very remarkable people.  Oh, and for those of us in the Bay
      area, the work of both photographers may be viewed at the Photographers 
      Gallery in Palo Alto.  I've not been there since Bruce's exhibit opened 
      there 1.5 years ago but will get there soon to see Don's work.

    What the workshop is NOT:  
    ---- --- -------- -- ---

      It's *not* about any of the following:

      * Lenses
      * Cameras
      * Lp/mm
      * "Rules of composition"
      * Rules of pretty much any sort - Mr.'s Barnbaum and Kirby are happy to
        tell you how they do things while maintaining that the student should
        be comfortable doing things completely differently if that's what works
        for the student.  For example, Bruce doesn't permit anything that beeps 
        in his darkroom.  But if you prefer a metronome, mechanical or electronic, 
        then use one.  Just find what works for you and then do it.  (As long as
        you don't try to bring chirpers or beepers into Bruce's darkroom. :-)
      * Introductory darkroom procedure
      * Mathematical formulae
      * A "fun photo tour"
      * A light skimming-over of everyone's work at the critique.
      * An ego building "soft-soap" praising of mediocre images during the 
        critique.
      * Slides.  Although I do think that a "strictly slides" photographer or a 
        color printer could benefit greatly from the workshop, it's really oriented
        toward b/w printing.  My color work, and I was the only person in the class
        who showed color work, was well received by both Bruce and Don, but, as I 
        said, the real purpose of the class is b/w prints.

      Not once during the 85 hours that I was around Bruce and Don did they 
      mention gear other than wrt darkroom stuff and in response to questions.  
      They would discuss equipment in response to questions and at great length.
      But rarely did they raise the subject themselves.

      Bruce, btw, uses the old-style "Time-o-Light" timers on the enlarger, 
      refuses to have anything that beeps in the darkroom, and seems to time
      his dodging and burning by intuition.  With incredibly consistent
      results.  I made a point of not mentioning my two-memory, multi-mode, beeping,
      digital electronic enlarger timer.  Nor my Zone VI Compensating
      Developing Timer.  :-)

      They are concerned with the production of images and seem to have little 
      interest in gear, per se.  I found this refreshing.  I gather that Bruce 
      uses a Linhof Technika (from photos of him with his camera) with a Tilt-all 
      tripod.  He's becoming quite enamored of his Mamiya 645, although he 
      considers the image to be of insufficient quality to replace the 4x5, 
      deeming it more appropriate for "hand-held" work.  Don uses a Technika
      as well.

    What the workshop *is*:
    ---- --- -------- ----

      * Intensive.  We went from 7:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. every day except
        the final day which as a half day.  Monday morning through Saturday
        noon.  I normally drink 50/50 real and decaffeinated coffee as the pure 
        stuff really affects me strongly.  But during the workshop I was drinking 
        the real thing all day and most of the evening and hardly noticed the 
        caffein.  Not a place for those who cannot function on less than 8 hours 
        of sleep per night.  Nor a place for those for whom photography is a minor 
        part of their lives or whose interests lie more in hardware than in images.

      * A place at which people who are committed to this form of artistic 
        expression have the opportunity to grow.

      * As much about what's going on inside the photographer as about 
        specific techniques.

      * Excellent in every respect.  Oh, BTW, Bruce's wife, Karen, was a 
        wonderful hostess, making everyone feel welcome and comfortable
        in their home.  I've come to think that once one leaves the urban
        areas it becomes impossible to find a cup of coffee that tastes like
        coffee instead of warm water.  But they served really great (and really
        strong) coffee and great goodies to munch on during the long sessions
        and this added to the pleasure of the class.  Even their dogs and cats 
        added a lot of enjoyment to the class. 

    What they teach:
    ---- ---- -----

      * Composition and light.  But he never once mentioned "rule of thirds"
        or other "rules".  BTW - if you ask "then what is there to discuss about 
        composition?" then you *really* need to take this workshop.  I did.

      * Intro to the zone system 101.  Or advanced study, depending on the
        group.  But he's not a fanatic about it.  He believes in making images,
        not in spending a lot of time testing materials.  He notes that he's yet
        to see an exciting image from those people who are heavy into testing
        of materials.  He didn't mention names, but I'd already noticed the
        same thing in the articles on materials testing by the "big names" that
        I see in the magazines.  (Well, John Sexton might be an exception, but
        there are always exceptions.)

      * His film development techniques.  Basically he uses Tri-X in HC110,
        exposed at EI of 160, although he's switching to HP5 because he thinks
        that it's "smoother" and he can expose it at EI 300.  He uses hangers/
        tank development and uses extremely dilute HC110 for "extreme contraction
        and compensation" development, such as for his exquisite slit canyon
        images and his awe-inspiring series on the interiors of the great 
        cathedrals of England.  These go down to N-6 but the prints are 
        marvelous.

        I questioned them because I noticed in some test prints that Don showed
        featuring extreme contractions that highlight contrast was really low.
        The highlights printed along with the shadows on #2 paper but were very
        flat and lifeless.  I was puzzled because I knew that the highlights in
        their fine prints are lively and full, even in those cathedral interiors
        where I knew that extreme "-" development had been given.

        The answer was that you just have to use a higher grade of paper so as
        to get the sparkle in the highlights and then you live with having to 
        dodge the shadows and burn and flash the highlights.  

        Bruce went on to say that he considers it a major error to try to select
        paper grade based on what will allow both highlights and shadows to
        print without dodging or burning:  paper grade should be selected on
        the basis of local contrast and overall effect, not by an arbitrary 
        standard based on how much manipulation you have to do.  He said that
        when people do select contrast grade based on overall density range in 
        the negative, the prints seem to be flat and uninteresting.  I wouldn't
        make so general a statement about other's printing, but have noticed 
        that to be true in my own printing.

        This was very heartening for me as I used to think that I had problems
        with highlights because I had to burn them a lot if I chose a contrast 
        grade high enough to make local contrast look pleasing.  Now he's 
        confirmed what I've been coming to realize on my own:  it's just in 
        the nature of the medium.  My "problem", always having to do lots of
        burning of highlights, is this master printer's normal way of working.

        He had a "self-published" copy of his text book (which will be formally
        published in the near future) and it contained his development times for 
        both N +/- and compensating (extreme contraction).  I'll not post them 
        now as this is available from him in either the workshop or in his book.

        I bought a copy of this self-published version for $20 and think that
        it's worth far more.  The formally published version, complete with
        photographs and other illustrations, should be an outstanding text,
        delving into the philosophy of photography and composition as well
        as the mechanics of the process from exposure through mounting and
        spotting.

      * His sophisticated printing techniques.  We watched him print three new
        negatives for the first time.  In 1.5 hours he had created  what I
        consider to be a masterpiece, far beyond anything I've ever accomplished,
        regardless of how many weeks I've worked on a print.  He employed the 
        following techniques:

        - contrast grade selection (he works with Oriental Seagull graded and
          O.S. VC Select almost exclusively and for this print he used
          the graded).

        - Split developing to fine-tune contrast using both Selectol-Soft and
          Dektol on the same print.  (Using his personal system of diluting the
          stock solutions double what the manufacturor recommends and then
          doubling development time.)  With his long development times he doesn't
          worry about timing things.  Just goes with how the image looks and
          his own (very accurate) internal clock.  His intent is to develop
          to completion and as long as that happens he figures that timing isn't
          terribly important.  He also doesn't measure terribly accurately.  When 
          he thinks that the developer is getting a little exhausted, he just 
          picks up the jug of stock solution and "pours a bit in" without 
          measuring.  Yet he gets very consistent results.  Methinks that there's 
          a certain amount of intuitive genius going on here.  And maybe my 
          mechanistic, timed, measured approach is not really needed.  Might even 
          be distracting me from the important parts of printing?

          More than anything, I think that he was trying to wean us (or some of
          us? :-) from our mechanical aids and toward a more intuitive and
          sensing approach to photography.  He was very disgusted with the
          "focus gauge" that I've been using, for example.  "Too mechanical!"
          "Gadgetry won't make your photos interesting!"  (Not real quotes,
          just attempts to capture the spirit of his comments.)

        - Dodging and burning using some really neat home-made burning tools.
          I've used something similar but he's refined the idea.  I'll be
          making some for myself asap.

        - Selective pre-flashing of dense (in the negative) highlight areas.
          Hmmmmm.  Actually it was "post-flashing" as he gave the flashing
          exposure after the main exposure.

        - Ferricyanide (aka Farmer's Reducer) bleaching of selected areas of 
          the final print.  This, btw, is different from dodging.  Dodging reduces
          density overall in the area dodged.  Bleaching increases contrast by
          affecting lighter areas more than darker ones.  Select your tool
          as the individual case suggests.  Also, bleaching can affect a far
          smaller area than can dodging.
          
          I've used this technique myself but never had any idea that you
          could do the things that this guy does.  The difference between
          the unbleached and the bleached print was subtle but dramatic.
          The difference between a "nice print" and a masterpiece.

          I'll not discuss bleaching in greater detail, but will note that both
          Bruce's textbook and Ansel Adam's "The Print" give good pointers to get
          you started.

        - Print washing:  he's somewhat cynical about the entire archival
          ruckus.  He pointed out that every time you turn around there's some
          new theory about what's going to produce an "archival print" and
          how to wash, etc.  Plus he has, as do I, minimal confidence in
          accelerated aging tests.  Putting it all together, he didn't quite
          say that "archival processing is a crock of s***", but came very near
          to doing so.  And, being a fairly earthy person, that's pretty close
          to how he would have expressed it.

          I didn't really know quite what to expect from him but was pleased 
          and made to feel quite comfortable when 1)  He commented that "if
          this isn't an archival wash I don't really give a s***" and 2)  First
          thing at dinner was to get the carafe of red wine *NOW*!!.  This
          guy I can identify with.  :-)
         
          He puts his prints in a holding bath for anywhere from several hours
          to a day or so.  Ack!  We're leaching out all those brighteners,
          right?  He contends that he can see no difference between a print 
          soaked for 24 hours and one soaked for 10 minutes.  Personally I've been
          thinking the same for some time now.  His prints glow.  Absolutely glow.  
          Unexcelled luminosity, especially in the highlights.  If this what a 
          print looks like after it's lost its brighteners, then you can remove 
          all brighteners from my paper, thank you very kindly.

          After the holding bath he selenium tones and uses an HCA bath.   BTW -
          he uses quite dilute selenium to minimize his use of heavy metals
          and soaks prints for a long time.  At that point he figures that there 
          can be virtually no fixer left in the paper.  So his final wash consists 
          of soaking each print individually in a try of water for at least 10 
          minutes and then pouring the water out.  He goes through this loop 3 
          times, squeegees the prints and air drys them on screens.

          Yup.  He doesn't own an archival print washer.  And here I just
          bought one!

          I also note that experts agree that using his "soak-drain" method
          of washing for an hour will produce an "archival wash", whatever
          that means.  He's only doing so for 30 minutes, but with all the soaking
          that they're getting before the final wash, I strongly suspect that
          he's, unwittingly :-), getting an "archival wash", whatever
          (once again) that is.

      - There is no drydown!  Basically, drydown is an artifact of viewing
        prints with dark-adapted eyes under overly bright lights.  He has an
        article on just this subject in a recent edition of Darkroom Techniques
        so I won't belabor it.  But he demonstrated his "two light" viewing system
        and it worked.  The print, wet, looked no better than the dry print did.
        I *did* think that I saw a little more detail in some highlights in the
        dry print, but the sense of luminosity seen in the wet print was not lost 
        in the dry print.  Highlights did not look darker in the dry print than
        in the wet one.

        Get the Darkroom Techniques article.  It'll explain it all.

        BTW - I was gratified to at last find in Bruce someone else who has 
        noticed the incredible amount that FB paper swells when wet and who has 
        theorized that some of the accentuation of detail in highlights of a dry 
        print may be due to the print shrinking back to its dry size, compacting
        all the little specks of black silver. I've measured 16x20 paper 
        to be, indeed, 16x20 when dry but 16x20.625 when wet.  That's a large
        dimensional change.

      - In addition, many of his images are composites of two negatives.  We
        watched him create a new one.  A slit canyon image where two negatives
        had interesting stuff but also boring stuff.  He combined them into
        one print (using two enlargers and easels) so well that you could
        never guess that the image was "manufactured".  He did it in less
        than two hours "from scratch", never having printed it before, and did so
        without benefit of a scanner or computer.  :-)

    * Don Kirby demonstrated using split filtration with VC paper to print
      a difficult negative (making a great image of a wheat field with storm
      clouds above it) and also printed an abstract in rock forms which he
      selectively bleached extensively, producing a huge change in the
      final image.  I was amazed.  I'd never known that you could use bleach
      to effect that great a change in a print.

    * Dry mounting of prints, including fixing defects (dimples and pimples) in 
      the mounted print.

    * Spotting of dust specks and etching out of black marks (from scratches on
      negatives and from dust on negatives at exposure time) on prints.

    Other things that I learned:
    ----- ------ ---- - -------
      * Paper storage:  he removes the inner light-tight envelop and just 
        trusts the box to protect the paper from light.  Seems to work just fine.
        I find the inner envelope to be a pain and put my paper in a paper safe
        while working with it.  But this is a pain if I'm switching contrast
        grades often.  I'm considering trying his techinique.  After all, all I
        have to lose is a few hundred dollars worth of paper, right?  :-)

      * One of the "bibles" often cited here in rec.photo, "Overexposed", the book
        on photo darkroom hazards, contains at least one notable error.  One of 
        their previous students was director of the USC Medical School.  The issue 
        of toxicity of selenium toner came up during that workshop and when he got 
        home he had a research team look into it.  They concluded that selenium 
        powder is, indeed, extremely dangerous if the dust is inhaled.  As we
        all knew.  But in solution it will not penetrate the skin.  Period.  
        So I've been wearing rubber gloves when toning for no reason.  Guess I 
        should probably refrain from drinking it, though.  :-)
       
        Although Bruce didn't go into the details, he also said that the 
        researchers found that the book contains several blatant errors on toxicity
        (all on the side of saying that things are more dangerous than they really
        are) and that it comments on the toxicity of at least one compound which 
        just doesn't exist.
      
        He notes that he's found that mixing developer, stopbath and fix produces
        an excellent fertilizer.  He used to dump it on his lawn and it 
        seemed to thrive on the mixture.
      
        He does, now, use a "Silver Magnet" to de-silver his fixer before 
        discarding it.
      
      * Get the hell out of PSA before you're permanently warped.  (PSA is 
        Photographic Society of America - the umbrella organization for many
        photo clubs).  He constantly criticized me for following too many "rules",
        as dearly espoused by the judges in PSA monthly competitions.  Especially 
        wrt composition.  He said that I needed to get the **** out of PSA before 
        the damage is too extensive.  Then said to forget it as it was already too 
        late and I need to spend some time seriously working to unlearn the 
        bullbleep.  That I seem to have a lot of rules floating around in my
        head, especialy wrt composition, and that they were limiting me.

     
        I have now consorted with maybe half a dozen top fine-art photographers at 
        workshops and classes.  Not one has had anything good to say about this 
        organization.  I also note that I've not heard of any member of PSA who
        has attained the stature of any of these top fine-art photographers.  I'm 
        starting to detect a trend. 
     
      * I, as was true for many other students, need to be more bold in the
        darkroom.  Make big changes, instead of tiny incremental changes.  Print
        with brighter whites and blacker blacks (I.e. more contrast.)  They 
        thought that many of my prints were muddy and liked them more when I 
        reprinted them during the darkroom sessions to have far more contrast.  
        Personally I think that they're somewhat too contrasty, but I 
        see their point.   I can see some major re-interpreting in the immediate 
        future.

      * Bruce devotes a lot of time to questioning why we make photographs.  In 
        particular, before the critique each student was required to explain what
        he's trying to accomplish with his photographs.  Make an "artists
        statement".  Then he might ask questions like:  "And what is this 
        photograph trying to say?"  "Hmmm.  It doesn't really say that to me.  
        Why?  What are you trying to tell me about this subject?"
      
        The critique lasted as long as necessary to discuss each student's work in
        as much depth as required.  There was no rush.  With 12 students, there
        were 16 hours devoted to the critique.  No sense of being rushed to get
        through.  Each student had the undivided attention of both instructors.
        I've been to workshops where the "critique" took place in a three hour
        period for all 15 students.  And was virtually useless.  This was the
        opposite.  Not necessarily completely comfortable but highly beneficial.
      
        I learned, maybe more than anything else in this workshop, that I need
        to work on the philosophy of my photography.  I don't think that I can
        grow much more just by exposing film and making prints.  I need to 
        understand, and to be able to verbalize, just what it is that excites me
        and how and what I want to communicate about it to the viewer.  This
        is very difficult for me but I'm now convinced that I must work on it.

        One guy was asking Bruce what was wrong that he couldn't make an
        exciting print from a particular negative.  Bruce kept asking him what
        it was that he liked about the scene and what he was trying to 
        communicate about it.  The guy couldn't articulate it and was frustrated
        because Bruce wouldn't say "burn here and dodge there".  Bruce maintained
        that the reason that he couldn't make an interesting print was because
        he didn't know why he was printing it and the student kept saying
        "I don't want to talk about composition, I want to talk about the
        technicalities."  Interesting conversation.

        During my "artists statement" I said, rather apologetically, that I was a 
        little embarrassed by my photos as everyone else's had been a relative 
        homogeneous body of work whereas mine were "all over the map" - a still 
        life, interior architectural, "grand vista", detail of a pond and 
        grasses, ...  Bruce asked first what was wrong with that? (I suspect
        that he detected a "rule") and then said that he thought that there was 
        more commonality than I was recognizing.  He didn't explicitly state what 
        it was, but I have a sense that he's right.  And I think that I need to 
        figure out what it is in order to continue to grow.  I will.

      * If you don't care about your subject then you'll never make an interesting
        photo of it.  I've been coming to this realization on my own for a while
        but we talked about it considerably.  I have now completely stopped 
        "exposing film because I'm here, even though I'm not really finding 
        anything super interesting".  I realized that Bruce and Don are
        intensely involved with everything that they photograph and it shows
        in their prints.  I think that I must feel the same or there's no point
        to bothering.  As I said, I was tending in this direction before the
        workshop but this crystallized things for me.

      * Shun rules!  Avoid rules!  Break rules!  Don't do rules!  Down with rules!
        Don't justify your compositional choices by citing rules!  We don't *like* 
        rules!
      
      * Bruce prices his prints based on size, although he thinks that this is
        silly.  He does so because the world expects it.  But he only prints 
        each image at one size, the size which he thinks "works" best for that
        image.  He considers choice of image size to be an integral part of the 
        creative process.  
      
        He dislikes the "limited edition" concept and considers his bowing to the 
        demands of galleries and starting a few limited editions to have been a 
        really big mistake.
      
    There was much, much more to be learned in this class and from these 
    people.  However, by no means do I think that I've "gone to the mountain and 
    come down with the commandments".  Nor would Bruce or Don want students to feel
    that way.  What I've learned is a little bit about how two extraordinary 
    photographers work, think and feel and now I can incorporate these into
    my own way of working as works best for me.  This is what they want the
    students to do.  This workshop was an outstanding opportunity for growth and 
    I cannot recommend it too highly.
