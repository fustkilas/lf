Large Format Photography: Toyo metal field 5x7

Toyo metal field 5x7
--------------------

**by [Q.-Tuan Luong](http://www.terragalleria.com/) for [the Large
Format Page](.)**

This camera seems to be an earlier model (probably from the 50's) which
was a basic 4.75 x 6.5 camera. The camera body is a metallic gray/silver
"hammertone" finish. It simply says "Toyo Field". It came with a
descriptive leaflet claiming that it is the first metal field camera
ever built. Various backs were available and I got one with a 5x7 back,
which is rare. The design of the camera is quite classical for a metal
field, and is inspired by the graphics. The only geared movement is the
front focussing, and there is no calibration scales.

This camera has a number of extremely good features, making it very good
for most of landscape photography:

-   a quite cheap (\$650) perfectly usable 5x7 camera
-   lightweight (6lbs), very compact (as thin as a Tachihara 4x5) but
    metal construction, which makes it rugged and rigid
-   very easy to open and to close (takes less than 30 seconds)
-   the knobs are of a decent size and are rubberized unlike on most
    cameras, therefore more pleasant to operate in cold weather
-   there is a bail arm for easy opening of the ground glass
-   the short bellows allow a good amount of rise even with a 120 lens

However, there is some shortcomings. The most serious is:

-   limited bellows draw. The camera has about 14 inches of bellows,
    which is really short for a 5x7 camera, and does not allow any long
    lens to be used, even at infinity. The telephoto lenses available
    just cover 5x7 with almost no movements.

Other features which I miss are:

-   4x5 back (actually, there was one, but now it's almost impossible to
    find)
-   more movements. The camera in particular has front tilt and swing
    and rise/fall, but lacks back swings (which might be a problem if a
    lens with small coverage is to be used).
-   wide angle bellows. Although shifts can be applied to the limit of
    coverage of the 120, the bellows provoke some internal vignetting.

The camera uses Graphic lensboard, which is a plus for Graphic camera
users, and a minus if you want to share lenses with other cameras. These
lensboard are quite cheap, though.
