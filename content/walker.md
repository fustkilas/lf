Large Format Photography: Walker Titan

Walker Titan : a note
---------------------

**By Lance Bledsoe for [the Large Format Page](.)**

I just got a flyer from Calumet about the new Walker Titan 4x5 Field
Camera, imported from Britain. This appears to be a very well made 4x5
camera, incorporating some sort of hi-tech polymer (plastic) body, with
metal fittings. The camera body and bellows are claimed to be water
resistant.

Walker claims that this camera works very well with lenses down to 47mm,
with the optional bag bellows. One feature I noticed immediately, was a
more complicated looking front standard design which would allow the
lensboard to be shifted vertically even when it has been tilted
rearward. On other systems, focus for very wide lenses is accomplished
by tilting the front standard rearward, but this action then makes even
simple rise and fall difficult, as the angle of tilt of the lensboard
must be changed to achieve front rise and fall.

Currently, Calumet is sending me more detailed information, but I
suspect that there is a good chance that the camera has an international
back, which will allow it to accept other Calumet/Cambo and Graflock
type accessories.

If this camera is all that it appears to be, it will certainly cause
those of us who are considering the purchase of a Wisner, Wista, Canham,
etc., to seriously consider it as an alternative.

The basic camera sells for \$1795, and the bag bellows is an additional
\$230. Lensboards are \$29 each, and are Wista compatible.
