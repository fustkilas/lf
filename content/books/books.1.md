Large format photography books
------------------------------

**Part of [the Large Format Page](..)**

This is a list of recommendations for books about and of Large format
photography, that I, and other contributors have found useful or
inspirational. If you have any favorite that you don't see mentioned on
the main pages, please use the link at the bottom of each relevant page
to add the title and a short description. I'll periodically update the
main pages. By clicking on the image or the title of each book, you can
read more about it, and even buy it from amazon.com (and support the
Large Format Page !)

### Instructional books

-   [General Books about LF](general.html)

### Photographs

-   [B&W Landscape](landscape-bw.html) and [Color
    Landscape](landscape-color.html). A few obvious as well as
    unexpected monographs representing this most popular photographic
    genre.
-   [Architecture](architecture.html). This is a natural application of
    large format photography. The buildings don't move, and their
    vertical and horizontal lines, as well as their restricted spaces,
    call for a strict control of perspective made possible only by
    camera movements.
-   [The Human figure](human.html). Although the large format camera is
    often thought not to be the primary tool for photographing people,
    it was actually used to produce some of the masterpieces of the nude
    and portrait photography in a wide range of styles.
