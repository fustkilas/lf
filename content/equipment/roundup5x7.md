Large Format Photography: 5x7 Field Cameras

5x7 Field Cameras : a round-up
------------------------------

**by [Q.-Tuan Luong](http://www.terragalleria.com/) for [the Large
Format Page](.)**

Summary: This document surveys all the 5x7 cameras that I am aware of.

Some of the cameras described here are just scaled-up version of a 4x5,
so look also at the [4x5 round-up](roundup4x5.html).

-   Most of [classic cameras](classic5x7.html) were made in 5x7 with a
    4x5 reducing back. Except the B&J, they have very limited movements,
    bellows, and are quite bulky.
-   The **[Deardorff](deardorff/)** (used \$600-\$2000) is quite
    comparable to some contemporary wood cameras. It weights 8 lbs and
    has 22 inches of bellows, and the standard range of movements (ie
    all front, swings and tilts at rear).
-   The **Linhof Technika 5x7** came in models III (1950 - 1956) IV, V
    (1964 - 1986), comparable to their 4x5 counterparts, and are
    discontinued. They are solid and precise metal cameras, but are
    quite heavy (V: 12lbs, III: 10.5lbs). An earlier model, the Medizin,
    which was made from 1936 to the early 1940's, was available in many
    sizes including 6x9cm, 8 x 10.5cm, 9 x 12 cm, 10 x 15cm, 12 x 16.5
    cm, 13 x 18 cm (5x7") and, in the Technika Standard 18 x 24cm
    (8x10"). The 5x7 model weighed 2.9 Kg (6.4 Lbs).
-   The **Nagoaka** is 3.5 lbs, about the same weight than a 4x5
    Tachihara, which, under is already one of the lightest 4x5 ! It is
    quite thin ( size folded is 8.25" X 9" X 2.5"), but reasonnably well
    built. The maximum bellows extension with the 5X7 Nagaoka is 385mm,
    minimum is 70mm. Lenses from 75mm on up to the Nikkor 500 tele work
    fine. The rear standard can be moved forward, making it good for
    wide-angle use. The **Anba Ikeda** is quite similar. I have seen
    them used for as low as \$500. Actually, if you have one for sale,
    please contact me.
-   The **[Tachihara](tachihara.html)** is also available in 5x7.
    Available from mpex.com for \$1300. This is a true 5x7, not to be
    confused with the 4x5 with 5x7 extension back. The extension/weight
    ratio is not as favorable as the 4x5 model, since it weights 8.5 lbs
    for 18 inches.
-   **Gandolfi** makes 5x7 cameras in a variety of configurations.
-   **Peter Gowland** can make a custom 5x7 based on his 8x10 "backpack"
    camera for \$1400. It would have front moves, 20 inches of bellows,
    and weight an astonishing 3 lbs.
-   The **[Toho](toho.html)** is also available in 5x7, but unlike the
    4x5, it's not an ultralight at 2.5kg (5.5b lbs)
-   **The Wisner Traditional field** (\$2250), has all movements on
    front, tilt and swing on rear. It is 7 lbs, but I believe it is the
    same size than the Technical, which is significantly more bulky than
    a Canham.
-   The **Lotus view rapid field camera** (\$2400) has all movements
    except rear rise (rear axis tilt and fall/rise optional) 680mm of
    bellows with lots of focusing tracks in Delrin. Cherrywood, black
    anodized alumnium. 6 lbs. It's Lotus best selling camera.
-   The [**Canham KBC (wood)**](canham/canham.html) (\$2500). all
    movements, except rear rise and front shift. 700mm of bellows the
    back standard can be moved forward (good for wide-angle). Modern
    look (Walnut and black anodized alumnium). 6lbs. Folds small.
-   The **[Canham MQC (all metal)](canham/canhamdlc.html)** (\$2500).
    based on the design of the DLC metal field. 600mm of universal
    bellows. Modern look (swiss cheese anodized alumnium). 5.7lbs. Folds
    small. 4x5 graflock back available.
-   The **Wisner Technical field** (\$2650) has additional movements
    (geared axis tilt, and gear fall/rise), and even longer bellows. The
    operation looked smoother than the wood Canham, and it seemed also a
    sturdier and more rigid camera, but might not be good with wide
    angle lenses. It's main drawback is its weight (10 lbs) and size.
    Classical look (mahogany and round knobs in brass)
-   The **Wisner Pocket Expedition** (\$3000) is more versatile than the
    technical, thanks to the geared sliding top rear focus which makes
    it easier to use wide-angle lenses. adds also geared front axis tilt
    and rise. The down-side of the additional features is complexity of
    operation and set up. It's remarkably light for its features
    (advertised at less than 5lbs).
-   The **Ebony SV57** these "no compromise" cameras offer large range
    of usable lenses (65-680mm), all movements except rear shift, good
    rigidity. made of mahogany and titanium. 6.5 lbs. No authorized
    distributors in the USA at the moment, so their products may be
    ordered directly from the factory in Japan. (well over \$3000).

There are a few monorail view cameras in current production which are
available in 5x7. I don't know too much about this category of cameras.

-   Sinar makes a 5x7 version of the P2 (15 lbs, \$6875, what else needs
    to be said ?). The cheaper route with Sinar would be to go with a
    5x7 format changing kit (\$2280) and add that to a Sinar 4x5 camera.
    The Norma (no longer in production) might be a better choice for
    field use (less than \$2000 used).
-   Arca-Swiss sells for all their camera lines (F- classic, F- metric
    and monolith) a 5x7" version.

My first 5x7 camera was a [4x5 Tachihara with an extension
back.](tachihara.html) This is a cheap (\$900) and easy way to get
started in 5x7, but has a number of limitations. Such backs are
available for several other cameras, including the Wista. As I got
hooked into 5x7, I tried two "true" 5x7 cameras ( a
[Kodak](classic5x7.html)(\$200) and an [early Toyo metal
field](toyo0.html) (bought from Midwest for \$700, they let me return it
after a month without any problem) and looked at many of them. I finally
settled down for a [Canham](canham/canham.html), which is what I found
works best for me.
