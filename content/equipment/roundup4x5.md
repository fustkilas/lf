4x5 Cameras: a round-up

4x5 Cameras : a round-up
------------------------

**By [Q.-Tuan Luong](http://www.terragalleria.com/) for [the Large
Format Page](.)**

*Summary: an extensive survey of 4x5 large format cameras arranged by
increasing price within categories, with links to user reviews. This
list is biaised towards cameras which are usable in the field.*

You won't find many of the heavy top-of-the-line monorail studio cameras
here. The prices listed are for new camera unless stated otherwise.

### Flatbed cameras (sometimes called "field" cameras)

All these very different cameras share the fact that they can be folded
into a box, which helps their transport on field since the package is
compact and the belows self-protected.

#### Classic wooden cameras

-   **[Kodak, Burke and James, Korona](classic5x7.html)**: A lot of
    variability among these cameras whose history spans the century !
    Many of them were designed as 5x7 cameras. They are very cheap
    (\$100-\$300) but not as slick as modern cameras. The
    **[Deardorff](deardorff/)** comes very close, though.

#### Lightweight/basic modern wooden cameras

weight less than 4 lbs, have double extension, fixed bellows generally
between 11 inches and 14 inches. Typical movements are full swings and
base tilts, and front rise/fall. These cameras are often made in Asia
with cherrywood and look beautiful.

-   **[Iston, Rajah, Ikeda Anba, Nagoaka](cheapwood.html)**: cheap and
    very light cameras, which some find rough and flimsy.
-   **[Shanghai Shenhao](cameras/shenhao/shenhao.html)**: a recently
    introduced (Jan 2001) camera made in China, more featured than
    others in this family: has back rise,shift,graflock,interchangeble
    bellows, 375mm extension. 4.8 lbs and compact. Can be bought for
    \$500, but a future official importer might charge more than \$1000.
-   [**Tachihara , Osaka, Calumet XM**](tachihara.html): a good basic
    field camera. besides minor cosmetic differences, these cameras are
    functionally identical (\$600-\$700).
-   **Woodman** (Horseman/Komamura) add a .8 inch front shift and a
    graflock back apart from that, the specs are the same as the
    Tachihara/Osaka. See View Camera Jan 97 for more details. (\$1080)
-   **Wista 45DX**: more rigid construction, back shift (\$1300). The
    45DXII has \*no\* back shift and costs the same. The 45 type III has
    a standard graflock back (\$1500). The 45 type SW has
    interchangeable belows. previous ones back rise and shift

#### Bigger/premium modern wooden and composite cameras

most weight about 6lbs (although the most recent offerings are lighter,
as indicated). For the added weight, you get more rigid construction,
triple extension, interchangeable bellows, generally up to 18 inches or
more of extension. You have a couple of more movements (shifts, lens
axis tilts) and additional features. Of all the flatbed cameras, this
familly offer the maximum versatility. These cameras are typically made
in the US or Europe with walnut or mahogany, however some new designs
use composite good quality materials.

-   **Gandolfi Variant**: composite black material, rugged but heavy and
    big. Comes in several versions (review in View Camera, May 95, Jan
    97, and in Shutterbug, May 1995). The most sophisticated version is
    very versatile with all movements, yaw-free, calumet compatible
    revolving/graflock back, scales, upgrades to larger formats. 20
    inches of bellows. If you buy direct from the factory, the price is
    only around \$1000, instead of \$2000 through the US importer. The
    **Precision Gandolfi** (\$1245) is made of wood, resulting in a
    lighter weight. It does not have the yaw free movements that the
    Variant has, and cannot be ordered with horizontal shift on both the
    front and the rear standards unlike the Variant.
-   **[Zone VI](zoneVI.html)**, **Wisner traditional** : comparable
    cameras. Beautiful craftmanship. Some say the Wisner is built much
    better. Classical look (mahogany and round knobs in brass).
    (\$1400). **Zone VI ultralight**: specs comparable to the previous,
    but hardware in black anodised aluminum and another grade of
    mahogany reduces weight to 4lbs. (\$1500).
-   **Phillips**: flatbed, but without side panels, sturdy hybrid
    metal/wood, with a hobby-shop/hi-tech look. standard movements, 18
    inches of belows (three fixed types). very light at 4 lbs. Phillips
    has a bare-bones philosophy and favors lightweight and rigidity over
    features. a bit fussy to operate. (\$1575). See [review from Photo
    Techniques](%0Ahttp://www.phototechmag.com/previous-articles/nov99-grad/grad1.htm).
-   **[Walker Titan SF](walker.html)**: a *plastic* camera made of ABS
    with stainless steel fittings. Folds flatter but not lighter. Apart
    from the material, which might be more rugged and less affected by
    environmental conditions (humidity and temperature) than wood, the
    features are comparable to a Zone VI or Wisner traditional. Graflock
    back compatible with Calumet (\$1600).
-   **[Wisner technical](wisner.html)** : Additional patented movements
    (geared axis tilt, and parallel rear fall/rise), and extra long
    bellows (23 inches). Classical look achieved with high quality
    traditional materials: oil-finish varnished mahogany, kid-leather
    and China-silk belows, round knobs in brass (\$1750) **Wisner
    expedition** : comparable to the "technical" but with slightly
    shorter bellows and lighter materials. The real weight is 4.2 lbs.
    (\$2200)
-   **Lotus View Rapid Field Camera**: all movements except rear rise
    (rear axis tilt and fall/rise optional) 24 inches of bellows with
    many focusing tracks (in Delrin, smooth focusing). Cherrywood, black
    anodized alumnium, modern elegant look. 5 lbs. (\$2150).
-   **[Wisner pocket expedition](wisner-pe.html)** 3.4 lbs, more
    versatile than the technical, thanks to the geared sliding top rear
    focus which makes it easier to use wide-angle lenses. adds also
    geared front axis tilt and rise. The down-side of the additional
    features is complexity of operation and set up (\$2500).
-   [**Canham**](canham/canham.html): a 5x7 camera with a 4x5 back,
    which is slighly bigger than the previous ones, but the same weight
    or lighter (\$2500). Modern look (Walnut and black anodized
    alumnium). 6lbs. Apart from the additionnal bulk, it makes quite a
    dandy 4x5, with its extra long bellows and movements (less
    vignetting due to bellows sag than with a regular 4x5).
-   **Carbon Infinity**: looked very solid but heavy and bulky. Lots of
    movements. Major problems are the fact that the manufacturer has
    gone out of business, and the price of this camera, which is very
    expensive compared to the Gandolfi which is targetted to the same
    class of photographers.
-   **[Ebony](ebony-rw45.html)**: these overbuilt "no compromise"
    cameras offer large range of usable lenses, all movements but rear
    shift, rigidity. made of ebony and titanium. 5lbs. (approximatively
    \$2900 and up). Their products may be ordered directly from the
    factory in Japan or through Badger Graphic Sales in the US.

#### Metal field cameras

They have a more solid feeling than they wooden counterparts, and are
indeed very rigid and sturdy, with greater accessory systems like reflex
hoods, etc... If your tripod is knocked over by the wind, a metal camera
is quite likely to remain functional with a few scratches, whereas a
wooden camera could be totally destroyed. For these reasons they might
be better for heavy use.

-   **Horseman FA**: small and less than 4 lbs, has the standard front
    movements and a 4-rod back comparable to the Linhofs. Focussing
    hood. usable only with lenses up to 210mm which are not too big
    (\$3000). **Horseman HB**: a newer camera (review in View Camera,
    May/June 95) same size and weight as the previous. Differences is
    that it is rubberized for weatherproofing and has no back movements
    (\$1700).
-   [**Toyo 45A**](toyo.html): features comparable to the lightweight
    wood-fields, has Graflock back. Extension is 13in. An optional
    extension back is available to go to 17in. Needs to drop bed for
    wide-angle. The new AX has reversible back making it lighter and
    cheaper (\$1500), AII has revolving back (\$2200). solid feeling but
    a bit heavy for its features. 6lbs.
-   **Wista VX, SP, RF**: standard movements, more versatile than other
    metal fields because of interchangeable bellows and extension rails.
    The SP is a VX with rear-swing, The [Wista RF](cameras/wista-rf) is
    a SP with a rangefinder.
-   **[Canham DLC](canham/canhamdlc.html)**: innovative clean design
    combining advantages of monorail and flatbed, this camera looks like
    black swiss cheese. very versatile : many movements, wide range of
    focals, "universal" bellows from 2.1 to 20.5 inches. compact. Offers
    the best features/weight ratio of any camera. 4 lbs 11 ounces,
    zero-detents are weak and make it difficult to align. Best selling
    since its introduction a few years ago (\$2150.00).

#### Press and Technical cameras

they are cameras with rangefinders, viewfinding devices, and could also
be handheld, or at least used without ground-glass viewing, which makes
it possible to do photojournalistic photography. Excellent construction,
quite heavy (6lbs+).

-   [**Graphic** press cameras](speed-graphic-FAQ.html): mostly big
    rigid box cameras with some very limited front movements. They were
    used extensively by photojournalists in the past. A variety of
    models, some leather covered wooden body, some metal ("super") with
    ("speed") or without plane shutter, etc.. (used \$100-\$300 for
    speed and crown, \$500 for super). **Busch Pressman** cameras are
    quite similar.
-   **MPP**: an English made camera very similar to the Linhof Technika,
    sometimes available on the used market, less pricey than the
    Linhofs.
-   [**Meridian 45B**](meridian/meridian.html): a used technical camera
    built like a Graphic, with some functionalities of the Technikas.
    Lighter than the Linhof, better for wide-angles than long lenses.
-   [**Linhof Technika**](linhof/technika.html): Extremely well built
    and solid, with a full-featured technical back allowing a fair
    number of movements and a range of lenses from 65mm to 450mm. This
    is the camera of choice of a number of great landscape photographers
    (used III: \$600, used IV \$1000, used V \$1800, used Master \$2500)
    Limited wide-angle capacities, except for the latest model, the
    Master Technika 2000 (\$5000), which comes with no rangefinder.

### Monorail cameras (sometimes called "view" cameras)

These cameras, although they are monorail, are usable in the field
because they are not too heavy or bulky. They are generally more precise
than the flat bed cameras, the adjustments are easier. They are also
more suitable for photography with very wide lenses.

-   [**Bender**](bender.html) a lightweight (3lbs) *wooden* monorail for
    \$300. Bag bellows and a longer rail are available. Not very rigid
    or precise (no geared focussing). You build it yourself from a kit !
-   **[Calumet Cadet](calumet/cadet.html)**. Two entry level cameras
    with fixed bellows (one normal, one wide-angle with a shorter rail).
    L-shaped standards. Very light (5lbs) and cheap (\$400/\$500). Quite
    rigid despite many plastic parts. Reasonably functional within their
    limitations. Accepts many Calumet accessories.
-   **Calumet 45N**. The proven Calumet camera is a fully-featured
    monorail (\$650), with a bare-bones design. It can be folded for
    transport, and is upgradable with Calumet accessories. heavy (8lbs).
    **Calumet 45NX**. adds to the previous camera calibrated scales,
    revolving back, and more solid and precise parts (\$950).
-   [**Gowland Pocket view**](gowland.html). A line of ultra-light and
    tiny cameras (available in several formats), with several variations
    which add convenience, weight, and price. There are several
    versions, so check directly with Peter Gowland. The original version
    were the lightest 4x5 ever made (less than 2lbs, 12.5" bellows). The
    "Baby" is 2.5lbs and has (full) movements on the front only, 16"
    interchangeable bellows (\$400). To change from horizontal to
    vertical, standards have to be repositionned. Allen bolts are used
    instead of knobs for some controls. There are two cameras with a
    vertical/horizontal back and more movements at 3lbs/3.5lbs
    (\$500/\$600).
-   **Toyo 45CX**. A new entry level camera, very cheap (\$600) for a
    fully-featured monorail. It's not really suitable for field work,
    though. The rail is very big and the camera quite heavy (8lbs) and
    bulky in the field (standards don't fold). **Toyo 45C** adds to the
    previous camera calibrated scales, revolving back, geared rise/fall,
    and a non-tapered studio design. It's a full-blown studio camera for
    \$1100. The standards fold flat, but it's 9lbs.
-   **[Toho 45 FX](toho.html)** (not Toyo). The lightest 4x5 camera with
    full movements and a wide range of lenses accomodated, currently the
    lightest 4x5 in production. 3lbs. Adequate rigidity, and easy to
    break down for transport. To change from horizontal to vertical,
    standards have to be repositionned. Produced and distributed in
    Japan (Around \$1500 in Tokyo).
-   **Arca-Swiss discovery**. Very functionnal, precise and well built
    cameras, with a Swiss high quality feeling. Yaw-free. Many feel that
    the Arca system has better ergonomy than Sinar. Relatively light and
    compact for a monorail. Complete modular system, but watch for
    incompatibilities between older and newer equipment. There are few
    US distributors and no website. (\$1400). **[Arca-Swiss F
    line](arca-swiss.html)** is regarded as one of the best lightweight
    (real weight: 7.5lbs) monorails ever for studio/field use. FC (C for
    compact) has a longer telescoping rail than the previous camera,
    which can be telescoped for transport, making it more compact than a
    Sinar. (\$2500).
-   **Cambo 45 SF**. Quite similar in design and functionality to the
    F1, but heavier (9lbs) and not as solidly built (plastic parts in
    some critical areas). \$1700.
-   **[Sinar A1](sinar.html)** is an entry-level camera, now
    discontinued. It was quite close to the **F1**, which at 7lbs is
    Sinar's field model, but remains quite bulky. (\$1800). Swiss high
    quality. Yaw-free. Sinar offers an extensive and modular system,
    with many accessories not available in other systems. Adjustments
    are more systematically done thanks to a built-in depth of field
    calculator. The market share in studios is probably the largest of
    any LF system, and rentals are easily available.
-   **[Linhof Technikardan](linhof/tk.html)**. Telescoping monorail with
    an unique mechanical design allow the camera to be collapsed
    instantly to book-size. (\$3000). Maximum extension of 500mm,
    handles a 47mm lens with bag belows. High german quality feeling.
    Better in the field (excellent portability) than in the studio
    (particular to operate and not modular). real weight: 7.4lbs
    (3400g). tripod socket location not so good at long extensions.
-   **[Toyo VX125](vx125.html)**. The design is quite close to the Arca
    Swiss. Light and rigid thanks to the use of modern alloys. Good in
    the studio (full movements, most of them geared, yaw-free) and in
    the field (only slightly bigger than the Technikardan), comes with
    universal bellows (58/300mm). Real weight: 6.3lbs (2850g). \$4000 in
    the US, but can be had for less than \$3000 in Europe and Japan).

### More information

A comprehensive table of specs can be found in Strobel's book "View
camera technique", which has been updated for the 7th edition in 1999.
However some pretty good stuff (Tachi, Canham, etc..) is still missing
from Strobel's list. The recent years have seen many new great
lightweight designs, as manufacturers seem to realize that it's not
because you are a large format enthusiast that you don't venture away
from your car. More current, look in the Nov 98 issue of Popular
Photography (yes !) which compares 18 cameras less than \$1850. The
magazine View Camera is a good source of descriptions and specs (more
like press releases than user's evaluations), but you'll have to wade
through numerous back issues.

Some of the prices in this page might be outdated. See listings in
[distributors pages](distributors.html).
