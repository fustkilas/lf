![Forstner Bit](ForstnerBit.jpeg){width="225" height="115"}Having
lensboards precision-bored with a machinist's lathe may be the next best
thing to buying lensboards pre-bored by the manufacturer. Metal boards
(aluminum or mild sheet steel) can be easily drilled with reasonable
accuracy, however, with a good hole saw in a drill press. Similarly, a
good Forstner bit of the right size works well for wooden lensboards.
Careful sanding or filing of the hole may be necessary for a proper fit.

Forstner bits in sizes up to 2" are fairly common at better woodworking
supply stores. [Woodshed Tools,
Inc.](http://www.router-bits-shaper-cutters.com/information/cfb.cfm)
also carries sizes up to 3".
