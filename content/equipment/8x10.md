Large Format Photography: 8x10 cameras

8x10 cameras
------------

**By John Sparks for [the Large Format Page](.)**

For new cameras, there are about 3 field cameras that make sense.

Phillips makes some really interesting cameras that are very light
weight but have somewhat limited bellows extension. If you are not into
long lenses, they are one of the best choices.

Canham makes a really good camera (I have one) that is also very light
(slightly heavier than Phillips) but had much longer bellows extension.
There are some things I don't really like about it (mostly that it's not
as rigid as I would like for long bellows extensions but it's hard to
have great rigidity and low weight at the same time, I also get pinched
at times with the lever locks, I generally prefer knobs). It is
unfortunately very expensive.

The third good choice is the Wisner Traditional L. It's about \$900 less
than the Canham. It weighs about 1 lb more. I don't know about it's
rigidity at large extensions, but suspect it might be better because of
it's construction. It wasn't available when I bought my Canham, but I'd
probably buy it instead if I were doing it over now (mostly because of
the lower price for a very similar camera).
