### Formats

In Europe, the formats 4x5 inches and 9x12 cm coexist and you can get
both sizes (but metric is easier to find). The size of the film is
different, therefore the holders are too, however, the exterior
dimensions of the holders are the same so you don't have to modify the
camera. The same applies of 5x7 inches vs 13cm x18cm, although both are
difficult to find.

In the United States, metric size sheet film is very difficult to get.

### Classical double holders

#### Riteway vs Lisco/Fidelity

Older Riteway Cut Film Holders (the ones with the metal handles on the
darkslides) are more highly regarded than say older Lisco. The Riteway
holders seem to hold up better. When I worked in a studio about 15 years
ago, my boss had over 100 holders all of which he had bought used.
Probably all but about 5 were this style Riteway and none of them leaked
light. Of the Lisco holders he bought, the failure rate (of used
holders) was high enough that he quickly stopped getting them (maybe 50%
of the ones he got leaked).

The current Riteway holders are made by the same company as current
Lisco and Fidelity holders (these three companies merged probably 20
years ago). The Lisco and Fidelity holders are identical except for the
name and slight differeneces in the pattern embossed in the plastic. The
Riteway holders also appear identical except for the automatic locking
built into the darkslides, and the very cheezey number wheels for
marking negatives. I have 2 of the current Riteways and lots of the
current Lisco and Fidelity holders. I can't stand the Riteways. The lock
on the darkslides takes quite some effort to unlock on my wooden camera
and make it very easy to move the camera when removing the slide. The
number wheels turn way too easily and the numbers extend into the image
area. The different handles on the slides make the holders too large to
fit in the quart size Ziplock bags I use to keep dust out of my holders.
None of my holders (all bought new) have ever had light leaks (except
the one slide I managed to crack, the holder itself was fine once I
replaced the slide).

If I were were buying used holders, I'd look for the older plastic
Riteways with the metal slides. They seem to hold up much better than
other holders of the same age. If buying new holders (or used current
style holders), I'd avoid Riteways for the reasons mentioned above.
**John Sparks**

Hi John, My experience with old holders (4x5) is the same. The Riteway
holders all are fine, the film plane is in the right place etc. I have a
box full of Lisco and Fidelity holders most of which have warped, or
maybe were just not accurately made, and are not useable. This is a
matter of the film plane rather than light leakage. I started measuring
holders after getting unexplained mis-focussed pictures. I found the
film-plane to vary all over the place in all but the Riteway holders.
OTOH, later 8x10 Fidelity's seem to be ok. **Richard Knoppow**.

#### How to isolate a bad 4x5 film holder giving unsharp images ?

You can measure them using a depth micrometer (one good enough is about
\$30 US) and a plate of sheet aluminum with some holes drilled in it to
clear the micrometer. Measure with a sheet of scrap film in the holder.
The distance from the reference surface of the holder to the film plane
should be 0.187 inches (I think this is the right value). check the
corners and center. It should be very accurate and should show no signs
of warping. If your holders are reasonably new you may find they are all
OK and the problem came from mis-loading the film. Its all too easy to
miss getting one edge under the rail. If you find a bad one keep it for
spare parts, especially the dark slides and end flap. **Richard
Knoppow**

#### Problems with used wooden holders

The main problem with old wood holders is that they can warp. The thing
is to check that the film plane is in the right place. This can be done
with a depth gauge and a reference block which can be a sheet of thick
aluminum with a hole for the guage in it. Put a sheet of film in and
check that the distance from the edges of the holder are exactly 3/16
from the film (4x5). The correct value for 8X10 is 0.251 inch measured
with film in the holder. Make sure the film isn't tilted in the holder.
Sometimes you find a holder that is right on one side but not on the
other. Plastic holders can also warp and wear but its less likely.
Either kind should be checked before use, there isn't really any
difference if they are OK. Once wood holders start to warp there really
isn't much you can do. I've seen articles showing how to mill them down
or build them up in some way, it seems a lot of work for something that
will be a makeshift. A lot of fuzzy pictures that get blamed on cameras
or lenses are really due to bad holders. BTW my experience with used
8X10 holders hasn't been good, far too many of them are way out of spec.
4x5's are better but I will buy only "Riteway" holders used now and no
wooden ones regardless of manufacturer. I also have a bunch of 4x5
Fidelity Deluxe holders I got with a bunch of other stuff. They are all
over the place, I think I found two usable holders out about fifteen.
The newer 8x10 fidelities seem to be much higher quality. **Richard
Knoppow**

Anytime I have ever bought or used older, used, wodden 4x5 film holders,
I have had problems - warping, dust spots, light leaks, etc. I qucikly
found out the hard way why you can buy used, wooden 4x5 film holders for
a dime a dozen at photo flea markets. Older plastic film holders
however, ones I bought used, have worked just as fine as new plastic
film holders. **Joseph O'Neil**

### Grafmatics

a Grafmatic film holder is the same general size and shape of a
conventional 2 sheet film holder. It has a "D" ring, a locking device,
and a small release tab. The holder is actually a light tight box with
an internal tray that holds 6 "septums". Each septum is a thin light
weight metal holder for a single piece of sheet film. These are stacked
one on top of another inside the tray that is then inserted inside the
outter light tight box. When used, the holder shuffels the 6 septums
sequentially from the stack to the film plane and then back to the
stack.

In operation, the holder is inserted into the camera the same as a
standard film holder. I recall that it is a little bit thicker, but that
should cause no problem. To bring the first piece of film up for
exposure, you rotate the locking device and insert your finger into the
"D" ring . With the thumb of the same hand, press the release tap and
pull the "D" ring so that the inner box is pulled out holder to the
stop. At this time, the bottom septum is freed from the stack and
springs push it to the film plane. Pushing the "D" ring to press the
tray back into the holder does the final positioning of the septum to be
exposed. After exposure, cycle the "D" ring again, this time you don't
need to active the release tab, and the exposed septum is pressed to the
top of the stack inside the tray and the film holder is now closed so
that you can remove it from the camera. (I may have the sequence
slightly in error, I don't remember if you use the release tab to
position the unexposed septum or the exposed septum, or if ilt shuffels
film from the top to bottom or bottom to top, but you get the concept.)

This takes about 10 times longer to explain than to do. As each septum
is positioned for exposure, a little wheel, positioned at the edge of
the sheet of film rotates 1/6 of a turn, exposing a different number
siloutte. When the film is exposed, this siloutte "exposes" a frame
number ( 1 =&gt;6) onto that piece of film. After the last piece of film
is exposed, the holder locks to prevent accidental double exposure.

You can use this holder to shuffel 6 pieces of film though the film
plane in well under 30 seconds, if you can cock the shutter of the lens
that fast!. If you want to expose both black and white and color film of
the same image, consider using the same ASA for both types of film and
alternating 3 color and 3 B&W films in the holder. Then just set up,
figure exposure and expose two consecutive pieces of film. This will
give you 3 pairs of B&W/Color negs in one holder. You can do this fast
enought that for most things that you would use a 4X5 camera for, the
image/exposure isn't going to change between exposures.

The Grafmatic film holder is a VERY compact way to handle sheet film,
and I think a much more convenient way that standard film holders. If
you find one, just be careful to be sure that the septums are not bend
or damanged. **Harvey Chao**

### Preloaded systems - Fuji's Quickloads and Kodak Readyloads

![](images/Quick_ReadyMONTAGE.gif){width="500" height="500"}\
Picture courtesy of [Robert White](http://www.robertwhite.co.uk/)

The film is in a factory-loaded paper packet that you put in a special
holder. There are several advantages:

-   You don't have to load holders.
-   The film is always clean (whereas it is difficult not to get dust
    while loading holders yourself)
-   It is easier to take notes for each sheet, since you can just write
    on the packet.
-   You can carry more film with you, since the weight and bulk is
    considerably less than carrying the same amount of film in holders.

Drawbacks:

-   Not all emulsions come preloaded, and it is available only in 4x5.
-   More expensive.
-   Some say that film holders ensure better flatness (see discussion
    below).
-   If you need to carry massive amounts of film (more than 100 sheets),
    it ends up more bulky and heavy than carrying the film in boxes plus
    enough holders to use.

Fuji makes the Quickloads. At the time of the last update (July 2004),
the following emulsions are available: Provia 100F (transparency) Velvia
100F (transparency, enhanced saturation) , 64T (tungsten-balanced
transparency) Neopan (B&W negative), NPS (color negative). The Fuji
holder is available in two versions that are almost identical, save for
a small ink stamp for marking the packet as exposed.

Kodak makes the Readyloads, with the following emulsions: EPP
(transparency), E100 VS (transparency, enhanced saturation), TMax 100
(B&W negative), 160 VC (color negative). The Kodak holder was designed
to take Fuji readyloads as well as Kodak readyloads.

In addition, Polaroid makes a large variety of instant emulsions, and a
dedicated holder to process them. This holder can be used with
Readyloads and Quickloads as well.

### Quickload, Readyload and Polaroid Film holders compatiblity

By [Robert White](http://www.robertwhite.co.uk/)

[]{#Readysteady}The following table was put together through straight
experimentation, by trying each film in each back.\
All the films physically fit all the backs but it is their operation in
these backs that counts. Therefore if it failed to work faultlessly
first time then in our opinion it doesn't work at all. The test was
carried out using the current Kodak Readyload back and both the Fuji
Quickload Mk1 and Mk2 backs. The only significant difference between the
two, that we are aware of; is that the Mk2 has a small ink stamp built
in that can be used to mark the film as exposed. The Polaroid back is
the current 545 Pro with timer and thermometer. It has to be said that
there may well be people out there with different experiences than this;
but it should go without saying, that there is nothing safer than
sticking to using manufacturers's backs with their own brand film for
absolute certainty that everything will be OK for critical work.\
However there is the obvious temptation to mix and match for various
reasons; so, hence the experiment.

### About the OLD readyloads

The OLD readyloads from Kodak hold two sheets of film. In 2001, Kodak
introduced a NEW readyload system, which holds only one sheet of film
like the Fuji Quickload. **The new system, unlike the older one, is
reliable** (see Paul Butzi's report by following the link at bottom of
the page). The old system was unreliable. A lot of people have reported
having light leaks problems with the old Kodak readyloads. Kodak
redesigned the holder three times. They had a dedicated forum on AOL for
"Readyload Problems". The fact that there are two sheets of film made it
worse: when you had a failure, you lost both sheets Infortunately, some
desirable emulsions (B&W) were not readily available preloaded from
Fuji, and therefore a lot of people put up with the old Kodak system.
**Please note that the material that follows refers to the OLD
readyloads**.

#### Readyloads, Quickloads, and Polaroid holder

The quick/ready loads are more convenient, cleaner and more expensive
than using film holders. I think it's that simple. Kodak Readyloads are
double sided (two sheets to the packet) and because of this don't work
well in the Polaroid holders. I've had thick emulsion films like T-Max
fog in the Polaroid 545i holder. The Fuji Quickloads are a single sheet
affair like Polaroid and work just fine in the Polaroid holder. We use
more Fuji than Kodak now mostly for that reason. We can go from proof to
final exposure without changing holders. If you're going to use Kodak
Readyloads you should buy the Kodak holder. It's a very inexpensive
plastic affair and it works fine with their films. **Fred/ Maplewood

I've used the following combos with the following results:

    Fuji Quickload          Fuji Quickload          Not a Single Problem

After a very high failure rate with the Kodak Readyload holder (over 50%
with the original holder, about 30% with the "improved" model III) I
abandoned the Kodak system altogether. In fact, I was so turned off that
they would market such a poor product and then blame the users for such
consistantly high failure rates (improper technique - oh yeah, then why
have you re-designed the holder at least two times?) that I have vowed
to never buy Kodak products again. I finally got smart and bought a Fuji
Quickload holder about a year ago. I have since shot several hundred
sheets of Velvia Quickloads without a single failure. No light leaks, no
jams, never a problem. The Fuji holder costs more, but IMHO it is well
worth it (especially considering how many sheets of film will be lost to
failures with the Kodak system at 2 sheets per packet times \$4.00 per
sheet for film and processing). The Fuji holder works smoothly and
positively. It feels like a precision tool, not a piece of plastic junk.
Some folks will say that if you stand on your head and tap the packet
just right, you can eliminate MOST of the light leak problems with the
Kodak system. I say, why bother? The Fuji system works right every time
(I used to shoot extra shots with the Kodak system in the hope that at
least one wouldn't be ruined). My time and my work are both important to
me. I can't afford to constantly have important shots ruined by poorly
designed equipment. I spent good money on a camera and lenses. I work
hard to get to the locations where I shoot. It doesn't make sense to me
to jeopardize that investment to save the cost of buying the Fuji
holder. No matter how good your lenses, the images will be useless if
you suffer light leaks. If you want to shoot Fuji film, and you need
dependable results, I highly recommend you spend the \$105 and get the
Fuji holder. It will pay for itself within a very short period. You will
never regret it, and you won't always be wodering which important shots
we ruinued this time. **Kerry Thalmann**
#### The slam technique

I have had several otherwise nice looking negatives ruined by light
leaks a few years ago when I started using Readyloads. Btw - I've never
had a similar problem with Fuji Quickloads. Only Kodak Readyloads.

I've found a solution to the problem, though: ensure that the covering
envelope is well seated in the metal clip which closes the bottom before
removing it from the holder.

How? After exposing the film I slide the envelope shut normally. Then,
keeping the release lever in the holder pressed down so that I can
withdraw the entire Readyload, I pull the Readyload out maybe 1-2
inches, and kind of "slam" it home again. Repeat. Repeat a third time.
Note that this doesn't take long. Just a second or two. It's really just
a quick "slam-slam-slam-withdraw the Readyload". It's the equivalent of
removing the Readyload normally and then tapping the metal clip on the
bottom on a hard surface to ensure that the envelope is properly seated
in it, except that it's being done in the dark inside the Readyload
holder.

The result has been that rarely do I have a light leak at all and on the
rare occasions that I do it almost never extends far enough into the
image area to be a problem. This is still not as perfect as the results
that I get with Fuji Quickloads, but then Fuji doesn't make Tmax 100 and
I used to have far more negatives ruined by dust on the film at exposure
time than I now do from light leaks with Readyloads. **Barry Sherman**

#### Other tips

I use TMX in readyloads extensively. I confess to having something of a
love/hate relationship with the things. I love the light weight and
compactness of the things. I hate the increased cost (incidental issue
in my mind - film costs are small compared even to gas for me) and the
increased fiddlyness of using them. On the bright side, they do offer a
nice place to put a sticker with notes on it; this sticker stays with
the film until it's taken out of the packet at development time. I've
ended up with far fewer sheets of film that wanted N-1 development but
somehow managed to sneak into the N+1 box as a result.
Kodak have gone thru several different versions of their Readyload
holder. It may be possible to differentiate between the different
versions and ensure that you're buying a recent one when buying used,
but I don't know how. I'd recommend buying a new one from a store which
turns them over, to ensure that you get a newer holder. They apparently
avoid some of the problems caused by the old holders. I've never
actually seen one for sale used, but then I don't hit the swaps and
stuff. Caveat emptor.

Lots of folks have had problems with light leaks, particularly at the
corners where the envelope seats in the metal clip. I've evolved a
procedure which seems to eliminate this. It's included below. My
procedure is as follows:

1\. Before I load the holder, I inspect the packet carefully. At one
point I determined that I was causing fogging because the non-clip end
of one packet was catching the clip on another packet, bending the clip
and causing a leak. I now stack readyloads (after exposure) with all the
clips at one end, to prevent this problem after exposure. Packets with
bent clips are now placed in the 'fogged film' pile. (I haven't found
one in months and months)

1a. I dust the readyload holder before inserting it in the camera. I've
gotten dust on the film, and finally concluded that it was dust on the
pressure plate, transferred to the film on the other side from the
exposed film. Then when you withdraw the packet, the dust stays with the
film. Dusting the holder eliminated this.

1c. John Sexton, who consulted on the readyload packet design with EKC,
told me that it was a good idea to expose the 'side one' side first.
Apparently if the packet is going to fail, it's more likely to fail in
that orientation. If it fails, of course, both sheets of film are
ruined. Better to ruin unexposed film than exposed film.

2\. I shield the holder when withdrawing the darkslide/envelope as much
as possible. I've had no problems with fogging occurring while the
envelope is out, but I suspect I've gotten fogging whilst pulling it.
It's vital to make sure that when you pull the darkslide/envelope, you
pull it out \*straight\*, with no flexing to the front or back of the
camera.

3\. Finally, the most important step: when you return the
darkslide/envelope after the exposure, run the packet back in, and then,
with the release button held in, grasp the envelope firmly where marked
for 'expose', and give the envelope several sharp raps back into the
holder. This prevents about 99.5% of the cases where the packet doesn't
re-seat in the clip. This trick was given to me by Barry Sherman, and I
think that using the 'slam' turns using readyloads from a nightmare into
a reliable thing.

4\. For people who are just beginning with readyloads, it's important to
note that you \*must\* hold the packet firmly where marked 'expose' when
pulling the darkslide to make an exposure, and must hold it \*firmly\*
where marked 'remove' when withdrawing the packet afterwards. I've
noticed people struggling with packets coming open whilst taking them
out of the holder, and it's almost always caused by holding it on the
'expose' part of the tab and having the clip catch on the light trap.
Note well: the location of the 'expose' and 'remove' switch when you
turn the packet over.

5\. Even when the envelope reseats properly, you can get minor leaks at
the corners. I noticed once that a stack of readyloads that I left on my
desk for two days all got fogged in the corner nearest the window (the
sun was shining on them directly) and now I keep readyloads in boxes to
keep light off of them. Use the little 'exposed' stickers by putting
them over the clip. This prevents the clip from pulling a bit when
snagged, and letting light in.

Kodak have gone thru several generations of the readyload packets,
ranging from the yellow ones of several years ago, thru at least two
different versions of the black packets. When they first switched from
yellow to black, I had a run of problems (mostly bent clips from offset
stacking the packets). In the past two years or so, I've had no problems
at all (at least since they started with the black packets with large
white labels on the clip end).

I use the Kodak readyload holder. I've tried the Polaroid 545i holder
and that's just more hassle than I can stand. Other people report good
success. I suspect that the Kodak holder holds the film flatter. I've
put packets in both the Kodak holder and the Polaroid holder and pulled
the dark slide/envelope and examined the film for flatness, and it looks
flatter to me. I didn't measure it, though. **Paul Butzi**.

I bought a pack of Tmax100 ready loads and did some lens testing with
them out side in the sun light. My experience is a follows: READ THE
DIRECTIONS: The two sided packs stick out the end of the Polariod 545
holder. The problem I had was that I couldn't pull the dark sleeve out
and trying to do so let light in the back of the camera. The reason I
couldn't pull the sleeve out is that on the inside there is a plastic
sheet that holds the film on one side of the sleeve. YOU DO NOT WANT TO
PULL ON THIS when you are making the exposure, only when you pull the
pack out of the holder do you hold this side of the sleeve. Once I
figured this out (once you develop your first film it becomes obvious)
and that you have to be careful when you pull the dark sleeve to take
the exposure all works well. I got no fogging from waving the packet
around in the sun light (not recommended). Sooooooo, well, they are not
bullet proof. Film holders are easier to use for the actual exposure.

There is a concern , raised by an article by Joe Englander in Camera and
Darkroom, that preloaded systems would give results less sharp than
conventional holders due to film flatness problems. He does a comparison
of focusing accuracy, and it's relationship to different film holders.
There are some very interesting shots made through the same lens (180
Apo Symmar) using both Velvia and T-MAX film. The resulting test
pictures show very obvious variations in sharpness. The best holder
(Grafmatic) is noticeably sharper than the Riteway holders that I
normally use. The Fuji QuickLoad, Kodak ReadyLoad, and Polaroid 545
trail in sharpness. The author explains that the ANSI standard for film
holder depth is .197". Most film is .007" thick. In order to have the
ground glass in exactly the same plane as the film, the back of the film
holder should be at .190". The center depth of the Graphmatic was .189".
The Riteway measured .185" on side one and .198" on side 2. The other
holders with T-Max varied from .175" to .205". The holders also varied
in corner-corner flatness. The test prints (admittedly based on flat
test images) showed some pretty dramatic correlation to his
measurements. **Todd Alleckson**

This is in regard to Kodak ReadyLoad holders. The sleeve, when pulled
out, stays within the "throat" of the holder, thus forcing the plate and
film back from their nominal location by the thickness of the sleeve
material AT THAT END. According to my measurements, Kodak did not
compensate for this discrepancy in the design of the holder. Therefore,
I shimmed my ground glass on that end by approx. .005", as I recall,
which seems to produce fine results. I usually make subtle adjustments
of the swing or tilt of the camera back anyway, which makes up for the
ground glass being out of whack with the lens axis. At least, I have the
confidence that what I see on the ground glass is the same as what hits
the film (aside from any warping or curling of the film). **Ken Schory**

According to my measurements, it's a lot worse than .005". The numbers
are at home, but I recall it being .215" or more from the septum (at the
edge where the film is inserted vs. the desired .197". Furthermore, the
positioning of the film in the Readyload accross the entire film surface
is not as accurate as the Quickload or standard sheetfilm holder. I've
seen some followup posts where people questioned the ability to focus
within .005" or whether that difference would be noticable in the
results. If it's within .005", I think the error would be fairly benign.
However, I think the error is actually worse than this. In doing
comparison shots of actual scenes with the Readyload and Quickload
holders, there was no question that the Quickload produced sharper
results. This is really too bad as I would like to use some Kodak films
more frequently. **Dan Baum**

Back in April, when the article in C&D came out, I spent some time using
a micrometer depth gauge to measure different film spacing in various
film holders: Polaroid 545, Kodak Readyload, conventional Fidelity,
Grafmatic. I found that my measurements agreed with the article: The
only two which conformed to the ANSI specs were the Grafmatic and the
conventional Fidelity with the Grafmatic being somewhat superior to the
Fidelity. The Kodak Readyload and Polaroid 545 both deviated from the
spec. I'd remember the numbers off the top of my head. Shots of a test
target (glossy magazine page taped to a wall) confirmed the measurements
with slightly noticible differences between sheets exposed in the
various holders. I used an aperture of f/16 on my sharpest lens, a 135mm
APO-Symmar, as I recall. But then I set up for a couple of "real world"
scenes, using movements to optimize the the plane of focus and stopping
down for maximum DOF, and used the different methods of holding film. I
was utterly unable to distinguish between sheets exposed in the
different holders. I decided that there are enough other factors
degrading focus in the real world including variations in focus position
(I think of those who doubted that anyone can repeatedly set focus to
within .005"), diffraction from stopping down to "real world" apertures
(not too often do I use f/16 as I did in the test target shots),
variations in setting of plane of focus, puffs of breeze, et alia, that
small variations in film placement don't seem terribly important. So
I've continued to use Tmax in Readyloads and Fuji emulsions in
Quickloads in the Kodak Readyload holder. I did do a little shimming
which seerved to bring the center of the holder into the ANSI standard
range, but haven't felt bothered by softness of focus at the edge. On
the other hand, I fully believe that Dan obtained different results in
his tests. We each try things for ourselves and conclude our own
conclusions. **Barry Sherman**

### For the Picky: Quickloads vs. Regular Holders re Sharpness

By [Dan
Benjamin](mailto:ReverseOrderAndRepositionAt@net.att%20photoart93)
I haven't tried Readyloads nor the Fidelity Regular film holders, so my
test results technically apply only to the Quickload holder and several
Toyo Holders. However, based on earlier experiences with Fidelity
holders and other information I've seen on this site and elsewhere, I do
feel it probably applies in general, that the results with regular film
holders will be superior to the packet holders, as far as desired
sharpness is concerned.

While perhaps most amateur and professional 4x5 photographers find
packet holders not only more convenient than regular holders, but find
that they give sufficiently sharp results (for most uses), my tests show
that where ultimate sharpness is desired, it's best to use regular
holders. Of course, sharpness is not the most important part of most
photographs, etc. - I am just saying that for those interested in such
matters, at times, the info below could be of value.

To be more specific, for those who don't print larger than 16x20 (from
4x5), or don't look at 16x20 prints extremely closely, and for those
those who usually need great depth-of-field that can't be taken care of
by movements (i.e. need f32 or smaller apertures), and for those who
find the decreased dust, lower weight, and general convenience of
Quickloads and Readyloads outweigh other considerations, what follows
won't matter (maybe that means 90%+ of the 4x5 shooters out there,, so
no reason to read further if you are one of them.

Here are the details of my results:

It may be known from other postings and articles on this large format
forum that regular film holders give a more consistently accurate or
flat film plane, than the packet type holders (Quickload, Readyload,
etc.). However, I didn't know how significant this was until I had
reason to obtain the sharpest possible result in a close up, and in
another case, of buildings in the distance. Using 10x and 20x loupes to
review my RVP 50 and Provia 100F transparencies shot with Quickloads, I
noticed areas of unsharpness that were at the same distance as other
areas that were sharp (although for the most part nothing looked totally
sharp). Thinking I didn't focus carefully enough, or the camera was not
aligned properly, or that there was something wrong with the camera, I
did some careful tests.

The tests: I used high quality lenses (for most of the shots I used
135mm Apo-Sironar S, 90mm f8 Nikkor, 300 f9M Nikkor lenses at f16-f22,
with some at f11 and f32, and a few comparisons with a 110mm XL),
focused carefully on different areas, using a 7x magnifier on the
groundglass of an Ebony 45SU, on two different subjects (one distant
landscape with fences and building signs, etc, and 12 foot distance
series of shots with several resolution targets on a wall). I shot more
than 30 comparisons on Velvia 50 and some on Provia 100F. I compared
exactly the same conditions - same focus tightly locked down and checked
after a series of shots, the same F-stop, same shutter speed, etc, even
the lighting was matched very well.

Viewing transparencies with a 4x loupe, comparing shots on the Quickload
vs Regular Film Holder, no difference can be seen if the f-stop was f22
or smaller (like f32) unless one looks very very carefully. With a 10x
loupe the difference is more easily noticeable. With a 20x loupe the
difference is glaringly apparent at a glance and the difference appears
to be large in many places on the transparency. The regular holder shots
always came out right on the money, whereas the Quickloads shots always
showed some areas of unsharpness.

For example I can easily read wording on signs and detail on objects
(detail that is contained WITHIN signs or other objects, the object or
signs themselves appear about 1/2 to 4mm on the transparency) on shots
made with the regular holder, but with the Quickloads shots the wording
or other detail is totally blurred, and nothing can be read/made-out.
Fence posts are blurred in most places (but not all) on the quickloads
shots, but uniformly sharp with regular holder shots. The difference
between shots with the two holder types decreases when diffraction comes
into play, which is around f32 for most lenses.

So what does it really matter anyway? For me, an amateur, if I'm going
to the trouble of lugging LF gear, taking a lot of time and effort and
expense, most of the time I want the best results possible, regardless
of my subject or potential enlargements.

I now feel that one of the reasons some people feel that high-end
digital may appear to be superior in certain respects to medium format
cameras, and scanning backs superior to LF film up to maybe 8x10, is
that the imaging plane in the digital cameras/backs is totally flat and
very accurate; but not so with film (even 35mm and MF). When film is
scanned, which is probably a compromise in itself, and the film image
plane was already compromised by inaccuracy or unevenness, then the
digital to film comparison is going to be even worse (than if the film
image was made with a totally flat and accurate plane). Of course there
are many other factors involved in a digital capture vs film capture
debate, but sharpness is surely one of them.

For other factors involving whether to choose regular holders or
Quickloads, I've found that in using regular holders I don't have to
worry about the packet waving in the breeze, and that it is quicker for
me to insert a regular holder, and then shoot, than with all the steps
involved with a Quickload - if the light is changing and I'm trying the
get a shot off quickly this has come into play. However, if the
difference in sharpness between the two methods was closer, I 'd gladly
do 100% of my shooting with the packets, so as not to deal with dust,
nor limitations on how much film I can easily take with me on a shooting
outing due to weight and bulk.

After going thru this exercise I did find that another photographer, Ken
Rockwell, who has a website at www.kenrockwell.com, Ken Rockwell,
already came to a similar conclusion (about the sharpness difference)
long before I did. []{#more}
