#### Lenses - vendors information - compiled by Oren Grad

**Rodenstock:**

(Current LF and "digital" lenses)
<http://www.linos.de/pdf/en/prod/rodenstock_photo_optics_e.pdf>

**Schneider:**

(Current LF lenses)
<http://www.schneideroptics.com/photography/large_format_lenses/>

(Current "digital" lenses)
<http://www.schneideroptics.com/photography/digital_photography/>

(Discontinued lenses)
<http://www.schneideroptics.com/info/vintage_lens_data/large_format_lenses/>

(Schneider Apo-Helvetar for Alpa 12 cameras)
<http://www.alpa.ch/alpa/helvetar.htm>

**Fujinon:**

(Current LF lenses) <http://www.thalmann.com/largeformat/mar-1997.htm>

On this page Kerry Thalmann has kindly provided scans of specification
tables from a Fujinon lens brochure dated March 1997. For non-Japanese
readers, these are easier to read than the tables on the Fujifilm site
in Japan. I have reviewed the Japanese web site today and verified that
Kerry's scanned tables are still up-to-date for the current product
line.

**Nikkor:**

(Current LF lenses)
<http://www.europe-nikon.com/category.aspx?countryid=20&languageid=22&catId=149>

This link leads to the Nikkor-W page; there are links to the other lens
series on the left side of the page.

**Caltar:**

(Current LF and "digital" lenses) <http://www.calumetphoto.com>

No direct link - need to go to Calumet home page and enter "Caltar" into
search engine in upper right corner, then click on individual product
links. Caltar II-N lenses are Apo-Sironar-Ns and Grandagon-Ns; Caltar
II-E lenses are Geronars. Caltar-D (digital) lenses are listed without
specifications, but the focal lengths offered appear to match the
Schneider Digitars.

**Sinaron:**

(Current LF and "digital" lenses)
<http://www.sinar.ch/down/sup/prka_objekt_e.pdf>

Sinaron LF lenses are Apo-Sironar-N, Apo-Sironar-S, Apo-Grandagon,
Grandagon-N, Apo-Ronar and Apo-Macro-Sironar lenses made by Rodenstock.
By specifications, the Sinaron Digital lenses appear to be a mix of
Rodenstock- and Schneider-sourced lenses.

**Congo:**

(Current LF lenses) <http://www.cosmonet.org/congo/spec_e.htm>

**Osaka:**

(Current LF lenses) <http://www.bromwellmarketing.com/lenses.htm>

Comparing specifications, Osaka lenses appear to be mostly Congo lenses,
except for the 150 and 210 6-element lenses. The specifications for
these two lenses appear to match those for the corresponding Wistar W
lenses, a series offered by Wista only in Japan, and which I've never
seen in the US.

**Wisner:**

(Convertible plasmat) <http://www.wisner.com/Page14.html>

(120 and 210 compact lenses offered with Flight 4x5 model; minimal info;
also made by Congo?) <http://www.wisner.com/flight.htm>

**Cooke:**

### Retailers

I cannot list manually every retailer of large format equipment. See the
[reader contributed list of commercial resources for LF
photography](http://www.greenspun.com/boohoo/related.tcl?page_id=LFcommercial).
Just a few words about where to shop based on my own experience.

-   In the US, the largest New York mail-order stores (B&H and Adorama)
    are reliable, have a large inventory, and competitive prices. They
    can ship anywhere in the world. Calumet is more expensive but offer
    better service.
-   Specialty stores (such as Photomark, The View Camera Store, Badger
    Graphics, and plenty of others I haven't dealt with personally)
    carry difficult-to-find items, and can sometimes offer significantly
    lower prices than the large stores thanks to alternative supplying
    schemes.
-   There are also a number of used camera stores which stock lots of LF
    equipment, and are your best bet to find old and/or inexpensive
    lenses and cameras.
-   Last, don't forget to look overseas, for some items, the savings can
    be dramatic, and the delivery as fast as from within the US. Robert
    White in the UK is a highly rated European dealer, and very easy to
    deal with. Christoph Greiner (chr.greiner.photo@t-online.de) in
    Germany can have better prices on some German-made items. Several
    readers have had a good experience with New Sankyo Camera Co in Hong
    Kong (newsanky@hkstar.com), however the payment has to be made by
    wire transfer. The duty fees are less than 5% and if you're lucky,
    you won't even be charged.
